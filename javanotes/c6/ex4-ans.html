<h2>Solution for Programmming Exercise 6.4</h2>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.4:</h3>
<p>In <a href="../c6/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.3</a>,
you wrote a pair-of-dice panel where the dice are rolled when the user clicks on
the panel Now make a pair-of-dice program in which the user rolls the
dice by clicking a button.  The button should appear under the
panel that shows the dice.  Also make the following change:  When the
dice are rolled, instead of just showing the new value, show a short animation
during which the values on the dice are changed in every frame.  The animation
is supposed to make the dice look more like they are actually rolling.
Write your program as a stand-alone application. Here is an applet version of 
the program:</p>

<p>In <a href="../c6/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.3</a>, there was a single panel,
which was being used as a drawing surface.  In the new version, there are two
panels: One is the drawing surface on which the dice are drawn; the other is
a container that holds the button and the drawing surface panel.  The main
panel class is the container.  We need another class to define the drawing
surface.  This could be a simple nested class that contains only a
<span class="code">paintComponent</span> method.  Since it is so simple, I decided to
define it as an anonymous inner class:</p>

<pre>JPanel dicePanel = new JPanel() {
   public void paintComponent(Graphics g) { 
      super.paintComponent(g);  // fill with background color.
      drawDie(g, die1, 10, 10); // Just draw the dice.
      drawDie(g, die2, 55, 55);
   }
};</pre>

<p>This just makes <span class="code">dicePanel</span> into a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> object
that contains a <span class="code">paintComponent</span> method that differs from the one
defined in the <span class="classname">JPanel</span> class.</p>

<p>The constructor of the main class sets the layout manager of the panel to be a
<span class="classname">BorderLayout</span>, creates the drawing surface and button, adds
the drawing surface in the <span class="code">CENTER</span> position and the button in the
<span class="code">SOUTH</span> position.  It adds a blue border to the panel, and leaves a gap
in the border layout through which a blue background color will show.
It also adds an action listener to the button
that will call the <span class="code">roll()</span> method to roll the dice when the button
is pressed.  Here is the complete constructor:</p>

<pre>public DicePanelWithButton() {
   
   setLayout(new BorderLayout(2,2));
   setBackground(Color.BLUE);  // Will show through the gap in the BorderLayout.
   setBorder(BorderFactory.createLineBorder(Color.BLUE,2));
   
   JPanel dicePanel = new JPanel() { // the drawing surface, where dice are shown
      public void paintComponent(Graphics g) { 
         super.paintComponent(g);  // fill with background color.
         drawDie(g, die1, 10, 10); // Just draw the dice.
         drawDie(g, die2, 55, 55);
      }
   };
   dicePanel.setPreferredSize( new Dimension(100,100) );
   dicePanel.setBackground( new Color(200,200,255) );  // light blue
   add(dicePanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
   
   JButton rollButton = new JButton("Roll!");  // the button that rolls the dice
   rollButton.addActionListener( new ActionListener() {
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
         roll();
      }
   });
   add(rollButton, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
   
} // end constructor</pre>

<p>The method for drawing the dice was discussed in the solution to
<a href="../c6/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.3</a>.  But we still have to think about animating
the rolling of the dice.  The <span class="code">roll()</span> method is responsible
for rolling the dice.  In the original version, this method simply set
the numbers showing on the dice to random values and called <span class="code">repaint()</span>.
In the new version, we want to repeat this action several times over a period
of time.  That is, we want an animation in which the action for each frame
is to randomize the numbers on the dice and call <span class="code">repaint()</span>.
The code for doing one frame goes in the <span class="classname">ActionListener</span>
that responds to events from the timer.  The <span class="code">roll()</span> method
simply creates the timer and starts it running.  (Timers and animation
are discussed in <a href="../c6/s5.html#GUI1.5.1">Subection&nbsp;6.5.1</a>.)</p>

<p>There is, however, one big problem:  How is the timer stopped?  If it's
not stopped, the dice will keep rolling forever!  The solution is not so hard.
We have to stop the timer after a certain number of frames.  The
action listener can keep track of how many frames it has handled, and after
a ceratain number of frames it can stop the timer.  After some experimentation,
I found that 10 frames, with a delay between frames of 100 milliseconds, looks
pretty good.  So in the tenth frame, the <span class="code">actionPerformed</span> method
stops the timer.</p>

<p>There is also one little problem:  The user might click the "Roll" button
while the animation is in progress.  If the dice are already ready rolling,
it doesn't make sense to start another animation.  So, the program needs
a way of determining whether an animation is in progress when the "Roll" button
is clicked; if it is, then the click should be ignored.  In my program,
there is a <span class="classname">Timer</span> variable that is set to a non-null
value when an animation is in progress.  When the timer is stopped, the
animation is finished, and the <span class="classname">Timer</span> varialbe is
set back to null. The <span class="code">roll()</span> method checks the <span class="classname">Timer</span>
varable to determine whether or not an animation is already in progress.
Here's the <span class="code">roll()</span> method.  Note that the <span class="classname">ActionListener</span>
for the timer is defined as an anonymous inner class.</p>

<pre>/**
 * Run an animation that randomly changes the values shown on
 * the dice 10 times, every 100 milliseconds.
 */
private void roll() {
   if (timer != null)
      return;
   timer = new Timer(100, new ActionListener() {
      int frames = 1;
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
         die1 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;
         die2 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;
         repaint();
         frames++;
         if (frames == 10) {
            timer.stop();
            timer = null;
         }
      }
   });
   timer.start();
}</pre>

<p>To use this in a stand-alone, we need a class that defines the <span class="code">main()</span>
routine of the program.  That class can be written as follows:</p>

<pre class="exercisecode">import javax.swing.JFrame;

/**
 * A main program that ust opens a window that shows a DicePanelWithButton.
 */
public class DiceWithButton {
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      JFrame window = new JFrame();
      DicePanelWithButton content = new DicePanelWithButton();
      window.setContentPane(content);
      window.pack();
      window.setLocation(100,100);
      window.setDefaultCloseOperation( JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE );
      window.setResizable(false);  // User can't change the window's size.
      window.setVisible(true);
   }
   
}
</pre>
