<h2>Solution for Programmming Exercise 6.10</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.10:</h3>
<p>In the Blackjack game 
from <a href="../c6/ex9-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.9</a>, the user can click on the "Hit",
"Stand", and "NewGame" buttons even when it doesn't make sense to do so. It
would be better if the buttons were disabled at the appropriate times. The "New
Game" button should be disabled when there is a game in progress. The "Hit" and
"Stand" buttons should be disabled when there is not a game in progress. The
instance variable <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> tells whether or not a game is in
progress, so you just have to make sure that the buttons are properly enabled
and disabled whenever this variable changes value. 
I strongly advise writing a subroutine that can be called whenever it is
necessary to set the value of the <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> variable. Then the
subroutine can take responsibility for enabling and disabling the buttons.
Recall that if <span class="code">bttn</span> is a variable of type <span class="code">JButton</span>, then
<span class="code">bttn.setEnabled(false)</span> disables the button and
<span class="code">bttn.setEnabled(true)</span> enables the button.</p>


<p>As a second (and more difficult) improvement, make it possible
for the user to place bets on the Blackjack game. When the applet starts, give
the user $100. Add a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> to the strip of controls along the
bottom of the applet. The user can enter the bet in this <span class="classname">JTextField</span>.
When the game begins, check the amount of the bet. You should do this when the
game begins, not when it ends, because several errors can occur: The contents
of the <span class="classname">JTextField</span> might not be a legal number. The bet that the user
places might be more money than the user has, or it might be &lt;= 0. You
should detect these errors and show an error message instead of starting the
game. The user's bet should be an integral number of dollars.</p>


<p>It would be a good idea to make the <span class="classname">JTextField</span> uneditable while the
game is in progress. If <span class="code">betInput</span> is the <span class="classname">JTextField</span>, you can
make it editable and uneditable by the user with the commands
<span class="code">betInput.setEditable(true)</span> and <span class="code">betInput.setEditable(false)</span>.</p>


<p>In the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method, you should include commands to
display the amount of money that the user has left.</p>


<p>There is one other thing to think about: Ideally, the applet should not start a new
game when it is first created. The user should have a chance to set a bet
amount before the game starts. So, in the constructor for the drawing surface class, you
should not call <span class="code">doNewGame()</span>. You might want to display a message such
as "Welcome to Blackjack" before the first game starts.</p>
   

<p>Here is an applet version of my program:</p>

<p align="center">
<applet code="BlackjackGUI2$Applet.class" width="466" height="365" archive="BlackjackGUI2.jar" alt=""></applet></p>

<hr>
<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr> 
<p>In the original applet, the button variables are declared in the
constructor of the main class, where the buttons are created. There are
no instance variables that refer to the buttons, so it is not possible to do
anything with the buttons outside the constructor. For this
exercise, references to the buttons must be stored in instance variables. The program uses instance variables <span class="code">hitButton</span>, <span class="code">standButton</span>, and
<span class="code">newGameButton</span> to refer to the buttons. These
variables are required in order to call the buttons' <span class="code">setEnabled()</span>
methods.  I also introduced a <span class="classname">JTextField</span>, <span class="code">betInput</span>, as an instance
variable and modified the constructor so that it creates the text field and adds it
to the panel that occupies the <span class="code">SOUTH</span> position in the main panel.</p>



<p>The buttons must be enabled and
disabled whenever the value of the variable <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> changes. 
At the same time, the text field should be made editable or non-editable.  As
recommended in the exercise, I wrote a method for changing the value of 
<span class="code">gameInProgress</span>.  This method also sets the buttons and text field to reflect the
state of the program:</p>


<pre>/**
 * This method is called whenever the value of the gameInProgress
 * property has to be changed.  In addition to setting the value
 * of the gameInProgress variable, it also enables and disables
 * the buttons and text input box to reflect the state of the
 * game.
 * @param inProgress The new value of gameInProgress.
 */
private void setGameInProgress( boolean inProgress ) {
   gameInProgress = inProgress;
   if (gameInProgress) {
      hitButton.setEnabled(true);
      standButton.setEnabled(true);
      newGameButton.setEnabled(false);
      betInput.setEditable(false);
   }
   else {
      hitButton.setEnabled(false);
      standButton.setEnabled(false);
      newGameButton.setEnabled(true);
      betInput.setEditable(true);
   }
}</pre>


<p>Once this routine is available, then any line in the old program that said
"<span class="code">gameInProgress = false;</span>" should be changed to
"<span class="code">setGameInProgress(false);</span>". And any line that said
"<span class="code">gameInProgress = true;</span>" should be changed to
"<span class="code">setGameInProgress(true);</span>". In this way, we can be sure that the
buttons are always properly enabled and disabled.  Note that I added
lines to the <span class="classname">BlackjackGUI2</span> constructor to disable
<span class="code">hitButton</span> and <span class="code">standButton</span> when they are created.
This ensures that they have the correct state at the start of the program,
before the first game has been started.</p>


<p>You should understand why I used a subroutine to set the value of
<span class="code">gameInProgress</span>. Every time <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> changes, each of
the buttons has to be enabled or disabled and the text field has
to be made editable or uneditable. That's four extra lines of code
each time the program says <span class="code">gameInProgress = true</span> or <span class="code">gameInProgress
= false</span>. We can avoid some extra typing by calling the subroutine.
Furthermore, if we always call the subroutine to set the value of
<span class="code">gameInProgress</span>, we can be sure that the states of the buttons and text field will
always be set correctly to match the value of <span class="code">gameInProgress</span>.
</p>
   

<p>The changes that I've discussed so far are enough to complete the first part
of the exercise, enabling and disabling the buttons.  We still have to implement
betting.</p>
   

<hr class="break">
   

<p>The <span class="classname">JTextField</span> for the user's input
is created with the command "<span class="code">betInput = new
JTextField("10",5);</span>". The first parameter in the constructor specifies the
initial content of the text input box. This is meant as a reasonable value for
the bet, but the user can change it if he wants to. The second parameter is
important. It specifies the number of characters that the text field
is designed to hold. The preferred size of the <span class="classname">JTextField</span> is computed
based on this number of characters. If the text field were being used
in a context where it would be stretched to fit the available size, such as in
a <span class="classname">GridLayout</span>, the preferred size would not be important. However, in
this applet, the <span class="classname">JTextField</span> is used with a <span class="classname">FlowLayout</span>, and it
will appear at exactly its preferred size. If you leave out the second
parameter in the constructor, the <span class="code">JTextField</span> will be sized to fit its
contents, "10", and it will look too small.</p>


<p>The <span class="classname">CardPanel</span> class contains two new instance variables for
managing the user's bets. One variable, <span class="code">usersMoney</span>, records the amount
of money that the user has. The other, <span class="code">betAmount</span>, records the amount
of the user's bet on the current game. The value of <span class="code">usersMoney</span> is
initialized to 100 in the constructor. At the end of a game, if the user wins,
the <span class="code">betAmount</span> is added to the user's money, and if the user loses, the
<span class="code">betAmount</span> is subtracted from the user's money. We have to decide what
happens if the user runs out of money. One possibility would be to shut the
game down, but that seems drastic since it's only play money anyway. So, if the
value of <span class="code">usersMoney</span> drops to zero, I give the user another $100 at the
start of the next game.</p>
   

<p>At the beginning of a game, the program has to look at the number in the text
field to determine how much money the user wants to bet on the game.  Several things
can go wrong at this time.  Since it's a little complicated, I wrote a method
to check the contents of <span class="code">betInput</span>:</p>
   

<pre>/**
 * This is called when the user wants to start a new game.  It tries to
 * read the amount of the user's bet from the betInput text field.  If an error
 * occurs, the message in the panel is changed to inform the user of the error.
 * @return true if the bet is read without error, or false if an error occurs
 */
private boolean checkBet() {
   int amount;
   try {
      amount = Integer.parseInt( betInput.getText() );
   }
   catch (NumberFormatException e) {
      message = "The bet amount must be a legal positive integer.";
      repaint();
      return false;
   }
   if (amount &lt;= 0) {
      message = "The bet amount must be a positive integer.";
      repaint();
      return false;
   }
   if (amount &gt; usersMoney) {
      message = "You can't bet more money than you have!";
      repaint();
      return false;
   }
   betAmount = amount;
   return true;
}</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">doNewGame()</span> method starts by checking if <span class="code">usersMoney</span> is
0; if so, it gives the user another $100 by setting <span class="code">usersMoney</span> to 100.
Then it checks the user's bet by calling the <span class="code">checkBet()</span> method.
If the return value is false, meaning that the value in the text field was not
a valid bet, then the <span class="code">doNewGame()</span> method returns without starting
a new game.  Otherwise, it starts the game as it did in the old program.</p>
  

<p>When the game ends for any reason, the user's money has to be adjusted. There are many points
in the source code where the game ends. In each of those places, I inserted a line
"<span class="code">usersMoney = usersMoney + betAmount</span>" if the user won or
"<span class="code">usersMoney = usersMoney - betAmount</span>" if the user lost.</p>
   

<p>I also added some code to the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method to display
the user's current amount of money. To accommodate this, this version of the panel has to
be about 30 pixels taller than the previous version.</p>


<p>One of the tricky parts of this assignment is to arrange things so that a
game does not start as soon as the applet is created. It's no problem to take
the "<span class="code">doNewGame();</span>" statement out of the constructor in the
<span class="code">BlackjackCanvas</span> class. Some initialization has to be done there
instead:</p>


<pre>usersMoney = 100;
message = "Welcome to Blackjack!  You start with $100.";</pre>
   

<p>However, when I did this,  I ran into a <span class="classname">NullPointerException</span> in the
<span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method because the
<span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method assumed that two <span class="classname">Hand</span> objects,
<span class="code">dealerHand</span> and <span class="code">playerHand</span>, exist. These
objects are created in the <span class="code">doNewGame()</span> method,
so removing the call to <span class="code">doNewGame()</span> form the constructor meant that the
hands were <span class="code">null</span> when <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> was first called.
This just required a simple modification in the
<span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method to deal with this possibility. I decided simply to
return from <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> after drawing the messages, 
if the hands don't exist. (An
alternative would be to have some fancy introductory screen.)</p>


<p>(I should also confess that I had problems with null pointer exceptions
when I tried to run the program <i>without</i> removing the call to
<span class="code">doNewGame()</span> from the constructor. In this case, the problem was more
subtle:  The <span class="classname">CardPanel</span> constructor was being called
before the button and text field objects had been created, so 
<span class="code">doNewGame()</span> was trying to enable/disable buttons that didn't
exist yet.)</p>
