<h2>Solution for Programmming Exercise 6.1</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.1:</h3>
<p>In the <span class="classname">SimpleStamperPanel</span> example from
<a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.2">Subection&nbsp;6.4.2</a>, a rectangle or oval is drawn on the panel when
the user clicks the mouse, except that when the user shift-clicks, the panel is cleared
instead.  Modify this class so that the modified version will continue to draw figures as the user
drags the mouse.  That is, the mouse will leave a trail of figures as the user
drags the mouse.  However, if the user shift-clicks, the panel should simply be
cleared and no figures should be drawn even if the user drags the mouse after
shift-clicking. Use your panel either in an applet or in a stand-alone application
(or both).  Here is an applet version of my solution:</p>

<p align="center">
<applet code="SimpleStamperAppletWithDrag.class" width="350" height="250" archive="SimpleStamperWithDrag.jar" alt=""></applet></p>

<p>The source code for the original panel class is <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SimpleStamperPanel.java">SimpleStamperPanel.java</a></span>.
An applet that uses this class can be found in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SimpleStamperApplet.java">SimpleStamperApplet.java</a></span>,
and a main program that uses the panel in a frame is in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SimpleStamper.java">SimpleStamper.java</a></span>.
See the discussion of dragging in <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.4">Subection&nbsp;6.4.4</a>.
(Note that in the original version, I drew a black outline around each shape.
In the modified version, I decided that it would look better to draw a gray
outline instead.)</p>

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>In order to implement dragging in the new version, we need a
<span class="classname">MouseMotionListener</span> in addition to the <span class="classname">MouseListener</span>
that is already present in the original version.  In the original, the panel
class itself implements <span class="classname">MouseListener</span>, so I just added
<span class="classname">MouseMotionListener</span>:</p>

<pre>public class SimpleStamperPanelWithDrag extends JPanel 
                          implements MouseListener, MouseMotionListener { . . .</pre>

<p>Of course, the mouse motion listener has to be registered with the panel
in order for it to hear any events from the panel.  This is done by adding the line</p>

<pre>addMouseMotionListener(this);</pre>

<p>to the constructor.  Here "this" refers to the panel object itself and is used because
the panel itself implements <span class="classname">MouseMotionListener</span>, and it
will listen for mouse motion events from itself.</p>

<p>To finish the implementation of the mouse motion listener interface, 
the <span class="code">mouseMoved</span> and <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> methods must be added to
the class.  The program does not respond when the user moves the mouse without holding
down any mouse button, so the <span class="code">mouseMoved</span> method is empty.
The <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> method must draw a figure at the current mouse
position; the code for this is almost identical to the existing drawing code in
the <span class="code">mousePressed</span> routine and can be copied from there.  However,
nothing should be drawn in the <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> method if the user
started the mouse drag gesture by shift-clicking. The discussion of
dragging in <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.4">Subection&nbsp;6.4.4</a>, suggests that the program should use an 
instance variable named <span class="code">dragging</span> to keep track of whether or not to
draw anything in the <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> method.  In the <span class="code">mousePressed</span>
routine, this variable is set to <span class="code">false</span> if the user shift-clicked, and
to <span class="code">true</span> otherwise.  The <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> routine checks the
value of <span class="code">dragging</span>; if the value is <span class="code">false</span>, it means that
the drag started with a shift-click and therefor nothing should be drawn.</p>

<p>Here is the code for the modified panel class, with changes from the
