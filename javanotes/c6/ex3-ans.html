<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.3:</h3>
<p>Write a panel that shows
a pair of dice. When the user clicks on the panel, the dice should be rolled
(that is, the dice should be assigned newly computed random values). Each die
should be drawn as a square showing from 1 to 6 dots. Since you have to draw
two dice, its a good idea to write a subroutine, "<span class="code">void drawDie(Graphics g,
int val, int x, int y)</span>", to draw a die at the specified <span class="code">(x,y)</span>
coordinates. The second parameter, <span class="code">val</span>, specifies the value that is
showing on the die. Assume that the size of the panel is 100 by 100 pixels.
Also write an applet that uses your panel as its content pane.
Here is a working version of the applet:</p>

<p align="center">

<p>This is largely an exercise in precision drawing.</p>
   

<p>We need a subclass of <span class="code">JPanel</span> to make the panel.
We will also need an object to respond to mouse events. As always, there are several
ways to approach this:  Let the panel implement <span class="classname">MouseListener</span>
and listen for events on itself, use a separate class to define the listener object,
or use an anonymouse inner class (See <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.5">Subection&nbsp;6.4.5</a>.)  In this case, I decided
to use an inner class.  The listener object is created and registered to listen
for mouse events in the constructor of the main class:</p>
   

<pre>addMouseListener( new MouseAdapter() {
    public void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) {
        roll();
    }
});</pre>
   

<p>By using <span class="classname">MouseAdapter</span> instead of
<span class="classname">MouseListener</span> as the superclass for the listener, I
avoid the necessity of providing empty definitions for <span class="code">mouseReleased</span>,
<span class="code">mouseClicked</span>, <span class="code">mouseEntered</span>, and <span class="code">mouseExited</span>.
<span class="classname">MouseAdapter</span> is discussed in <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.5">Subection&nbsp;6.4.5</a>.
In the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> method, <span class="code">roll()</span> is a method that 
is defined in the main class; it just rolls the dice.  It would be
reasonable to put the code for rolling the dice in <span class="code">mousePressed()</span>,
but writing a subroutine to do it makes the program a little easier to
modify for the next exercise. Anyway, when you can identify a
self-contained, meaningful task to be performed, it's never a bad a idea to
write a subroutine to do it. It will make the program more readable, if nothing
else. My roll subroutine assigns random values to the dice and calls
<span class="code">repaint()</span> so that the new values will be shown.</p>



<p>The hardest part of this exercise is drawing the dice. I made each die 35
pixels wide, leaving a 10 pixel border on each side and 10 pixels between the
dice, for a total of 100 pixels.
The top left corner of the left die is at <span class="code">(10,10)</span>, the top left
corner of the right die is at <span class="code">(55,55)</span>. The 55 includes the 10 pixel
border on the left, the 35 pixel width of the other die, and the 10 pixels
between the dice. The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
method calls a <span class="code">drawDie()</span> routine to draw
each die, using the commands:</p>


<pre>drawDie(g, die1, 10, 10);
drawDie(g, die2, 55, 55);</pre>


<p>where <span class="code">die1</span> is the numerical value shown on the first die and
<span class="code">die2</span> is the numerical value of the second die.</p>


<p>As for the <span class="code">drawDie</span> routine, there are two quite different
algorithms that could have been used for drawing the dots. Either:</p>


<pre>if the value shown is 1
    draw 1 dot (in the center)
else if the value shown is 2
    draw 2 dots (in the top-left and bottom-right corners)
  .
  .
  .
else if the value shown is 6
    draw 6 dots (along the left and right edges)</pre>


<p>Or:</p>


<pre>if the value has a dot in the top-left corner
     draw the top-left dot
else if the value has a dot in the top-right corner
     draw the top-right dot
   .
   .
   .
else if the value has a dot in the bottom-right corner
     draw the bottom-right dot</pre>


<p>Although the first algorithm is more obvious, the second requires much less
typing. (The first algorithm ends up using 21 <span class="code">drawOval()</span> commands,
while the second uses only 7.) Furthermore, after drawing the dice on paper, I
found that the conditions for testing when a given dot needs to be drawn are
simpler than I expected. For example, the values that need a dot in the
top-left position are all the values greater than 1. The algorithm leads to my
<span class="code">drawDice()</span> routine:</p>


<pre>/**
 * Draw a die with upper left corner at (x,y).  The die is
 * 35 by 35 pixels in size.  The val parameter gives the
 * value showing on the die (that is, the number of dots).
 */
private void drawDie(Graphics g, int val, int x, int y) {
     g.setColor(Color.white);
     g.fillRect(x, y, 35, 35);
     g.setColor(Color.black);
     g.drawRect(x, y, 34, 34);
     if (val &gt; 1)  // upper left dot
        g.fillOval(x+3, y+3, 9, 9);
     if (val &gt; 3)  // upper right dot
        g.fillOval(x+23, y+3, 9, 9);
     if (val == 6) // middle left dot
        g.fillOval(x+3, y+13, 9, 9);
     if (val % 2 == 1) // middle dot (for odd-numbered val's)
        g.fillOval(x+13, y+13, 9, 9);
     if (val == 6) // middle right dot
        g.fillOval(x+23, y+13, 9, 9);
     if (val &gt; 3)  // bottom left dot
        g.fillOval(x+3, y+23, 9, 9);
     if (val &gt; 1)  // bottom right dot
        g.fillOval(x+23, y+23, 9,9);
}</pre>


<p>It took some care to figure out the numbers to use in the <span class="code">fillOval</span>
commands. The individual dots have a diameter of 9 pixels. There are three rows
of dots, which have a combined height of 27 pixels. That leaves 35-27, or 8
pixels for spacing. I use 3 pixels between the dots and the edge of the die,
and 1 pixel between rows. This puts the tops of the rows at 3, 3+9+1, and
3+9+1+9+1, that is, at 3, 13, and 23. The columns use the same numbers. (If you
believe that I got all this right the first time, I won't disillusion you!)</p>


<p>The <span class="code">paintComponent</span> method just draws the two dice and the border around
the panel</p>


<pre>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
   super.paintComponent(g);  // fill with background color.
   g.setColor( Color.BLUE );
   g.drawRect(0,0,99,99);
   g.drawRect(1,1,97,97);
   drawDie(g, die1, 10, 10);
   drawDie(g, die2, 55, 55);
}</pre>
   
   

<p>It is easy to write an applet class that uses a <span class="classname">DicePanel</span>
as its content pane, and I do not give the source code for it here.
(Look at the bottom of the solution to <a href="../c6/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.2</a> if you 
are still not sure how to do it.)</p>


<p>One more small remark on the solution:  The constructor of the <span class="classname">DicePanel</span>
class sets the preferred size of the panel to be 100-by-100 pixels, using the command:</p>
   

<pre>setPreferredSize( new Dimension(100,100) );</pre>


<p>When a panel is used in an applet, this has no effect since the size of the
applet is set in the &lt;applet&gt; tag in the HTML source code of the web page
on which the applet appears.  However, if a <span class="classname">DicePanel</span> is
used in some context where its preferred size is taken into account, it's
important for it to have a correctly set preferred size.</p>
