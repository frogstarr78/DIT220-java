<h2>Solution for Programmming Exercise 6.6</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.6:</h3>
<p>For this exercise, you
should modify the SubKiller game from <a href="../c6/s5.html#GUI1.5.4">Subection&nbsp;6.5.4</a>. You
can start with the existing source code, from the file 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SubKillerPanel.java">SubKillerPanel.java</a></span>. Modify the game so it
keeps track of the number of hits and misses and displays these quantities.
That is, every time the depth charge blows up the sub, the number of hits goes
up by one. Every time the depth charge falls off the bottom of the screen
without hitting the sub, the number of misses goes up by one. There is room at
the top of the panel to display these numbers. To do this exercise, you only
have to add a half-dozen lines to the source code. But you have to figure out
what they are and where to add them. To do this, you'll have to read the source
code closely enough to understand how it works.</p>

<hr>
<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>You can do this exercise by adding exactly seven lines to the original
version, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SubKillerPanel.java">SubKillerPanel.java</a></span>. I used
two lines to declare instance variables named <span class="code">hits</span> and
<span class="code">misses</span>. These variables have to be updated whenever the depth charge
hits the sub or falls off the bottom of the panel. These events are already
detected by the panel, in the <span class="code">updateForNextFrame()</span> method of the
<span class="classname">Bomb</span> class. At the point
where this method detects that the depth charge has hit the sub, I add the
command "<span class="code">hits++;</span>" to chalk up another hit for the user. At the point
in where it is determined that the <span class="code">y</span>-coordinate
of the depth charge has exceeded the height of the panel, I add the command
"<span class="code">misses++;</span>" to record the fact that the sub has escaped destruction
this time.</p>


<p>The only other thing to do is to display the number of hits and misses at
the top of the panel. This is part of drawing the picture, so it is done in the
<span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method. The information is output with two
<span class="code">drawString</span> commands. We need one more command to make sure that the
strings are displayed in a color that can be seen:</p>


<pre>g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
g.drawString("Number of hits:   " + hits, 15, 24);
g.drawString("Number of misses: " + misses, 15, 45);</pre>


<p>(Using these coordinates, the messages about hits and misses were
drawn over the "CLICK TO ACTIVATE" message, so I also move the
"CLICK TO ACIVATE" message to the bottom of the screen.)</p>
   

<p>I made one further change when I decided that I wanted the output to be
displayed in a larger font. I create a new font, store it in an instance
variable named <span class="code">infoFont</span>, and use the command
"<span class="code">g.setFont(infoFont);</span>" before drawing the strings.</p>
   


<p>Here is the applet version of the new program, so you can try it out:</p>

<p align="center">
<applet code="SubKillerApplet2.class" width="600" height="475" archive="SubKiller2.jar" alt=""></applet></p>



<p>The source code is shown below. Changes from the original version are shown
in red.  To use the panel class, you still have to write an
applet class or a class that contains a main routine; I leave that to you.</p>
