<h2 class="section_title">The Basic GUI Application</h2>
<hr class="break">
   

<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>here are two basic types</span> of GUI program in Java:
<span class="newword">stand-alone applications</span> and <span class="newword">applets</span>.
An applet is a program that runs in a rectangular area on a Web page.  Applets
are generally small programs, meant to do fairly simple things, although there is
nothing to stop them from being very complex.  Applets were responsible for
a lot of the initial excitement about Java when it was introduced, since they
could do things that could not otherwise be done on Web pages.  However, there
are now easier ways to do many of the more basic things that can be done with
applets, and they are no longer the main focus of interest in Java.  Nevertheless,
there are still some things that can be done best with applets, and they are
still fairly common on the Web.  We will look at applets in the
<a href="../c6/s2.html">next section</a>.</p>
   

<p>A stand-alone application is a program that runs on its own, without
depending on a Web browser.  You've been writing stand-alone applications
all along.  Any class that has a <span class="code">main()</span> routine defines a
stand-alone application; running the program just means executing this
<span class="code">main()</span> routine.  However, the programs that you've seen up
till now have been "command-line" programs, where the user and computer
interact by typing things back and forth to each other.  A GUI program
offers a much richer type of user interface, where the user uses a mouse
and keyboard to interact with GUI components such as windows, menus, buttons,
check boxes, text input boxes, scroll bars, and so on.  The main routine
of a GUI program creates one or more such components and displays them
on the computer screen.  Very often, that's all it does. Once a GUI
component has been created, it follows its <b>own</b> programming---programming
that tells it how to draw itself on the screen and how to respond to events
such as being clicked on by the user.</p>


<p>A GUI program doesn't have to be immensely complex.  We can, for example
write a very simple GUI "Hello World" program that says "Hello" to the user,
but does it by opening a window where the the greeting is displayed:</p>
   

<pre>import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class HelloWorldGUI1 {
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null, "Hello World!" );
   }

}</pre>   
   

<p>When this program is run, a window appears on the screen that contains the
message "Hello World!".   The window also contains an "OK" button for the user 
to click after reading the message.  When the user clicks this button, the 
window closes and the program ends.  By the way, this program can be placed
in a file named <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/HelloWorldGUI1.java">HelloWorldGUI1.java</a></span>, compiled, and run
just like any other Java program.</p>
   

<p>Now, this program is already doing some pretty fancy stuff.  It creates a window,
it draws the contents of that window, and it handles the event that is generated
when the user clicks the button.  The reason the program was so easy to write is that all
the work is done by <span class="code">showMessageDialog()</span>, a <span class="code">static</span> method in the
built-in class <span class="classname">JOptionPane</span>.  (Note that the source code 
"imports" the class <span class="code">javax.swing.JOptionPane</span> to make it possible
to refer to the <span class="classname">JOptionPane</span> class using its simple name.
See <a href="../c4/s5.html#subroutines.5.3">Subection&nbsp;4.5.3</a> for information about importing classes from
Java's standard packages.)</p>
   

<p>If you want to display a message to the user in a GUI program, this is a good way to
do it:  Just use a standard class that already knows how to do the work!  And in fact,
<span class="classname">JOptionPane</span> is regularly used for just this purpose 
(but as part of a larger program, usually).
Of course, if you want to do anything serious in a GUI program, there is a lot more to learn.  To give you
an idea of the types of things that are involved, we'll look at a short GUI program that
does the same things as the previous program -- open a window containing a message
and an OK button, and respond to a click on the button by ending the program -- but
does it all by hand instead of by using the built-in <span class="classname">JOptionPane</span> class.
Mind you, this is <b>not</b> a good way to write the program, but it will
illustrate some important aspects of GUI programming in Java.</p>
   

<p>Here is the source code for the program.  You are not expected to understand it yet.
I will explain how it works below, but it will take the rest of the chapter before you
will really understand completely.  In this section, you will just get a brief overview
of GUI programming.</p>

      window.setContentPane(content);
      window.setSize(250,100);

   }

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI1.1.1">6.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;JFrame and JPanel</a>
</h3>
   

<p>In a Java GUI program, each GUI component in the interface is represented by an object in the program.
One of the most fundamental types of component is the <span class="newword">window</span>.  Windows have
many behaviors.  They can be opened and closed.  They can be resized.  They have "titles" that
are displayed in the title bar above the window.  And most important, they can contain other
GUI components such as buttons and menus.</p>
   

<p>Java, of course, has a built-in class to represent windows.  There are actually several
different types of window, but the most common type is represented by the <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
class (which is included in the package <span class="code">javax.swing</span>).
A <span class="classname">JFrame</span> is an independent window that can, for example, act as the main window
of an application.  One of the most important things to understand is that a <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
object comes with many of the behaviors of windows already programmed in.  In particular, it
comes with the basic properties shared by all windows, such as a titlebar and the ability to be opened and
closed.  Since a <span class="classname">JFrame</span> comes with these behaviors, you don't have to
program them yourself!  This is, of course, one of the central ideas of object-oriented programming.
What a <span class="classname">JFrame</span> doesn't come with, of course, is <span class="newword">content</span>, the 
stuff that is contained in the window.  If you don't add any other content to a <span class="classname">JFrame</span>,
it will just display a large blank area.  You can add content either by creating a <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
object and then adding the content to it or by creating a subclass of <span class="classname">JFrame</span> and
adding the content in the constructor of that subclass.</p>
   

<p>The main program above declares a variable, <span class="code">window</span>, of type <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
and sets it to refer to a new window object with the statement:</p>
  

<pre>JFrame window = new JFrame("GUI Test");</pre>
   

<p>The parameter in the constructor, "GUI Test", specifies the title that will be displayed in 
the titlebar of the window.  This line creates the window object, but the window itself is
not yet visible on the screen.  Before making the window visible, some of its properties are set
with these statements:</p>
   

<pre>window.setContentPane(content);
window.setSize(250,100);
window.setLocation(100,100);</pre>
   

<p>The first line here sets the content of the window. (The content itself was created earlier
in the main program.)  The second line says that the window will be 250 pixels wide and 100 pixels
high.  The third line says that the upper left corner of the window will be 100 pixels over from
the left edge of the screen and 100 pixels down from the top.  Once all this has been set
up, the window is actually made visible on the screen with the command:</p>
   

<pre>window.setVisible(true);</pre>
   

<p>It might look as if the program ends at that point, and, in fact, the <span class="code">main()</span> routine
does end.  However, the the window is still on the screen and the program as a whole does not end
until the user clicks the OK button.</p>


<hr class="break">
   

<p>The content that is displayed in a <span class="classname">JFrame</span> is called its
<span class="newword">content pane</span>.  (In addition to its content pane, a <span class="classname">JFrame</span> can also have
a menu bar, which is a separate thing that I will talk about later.)  A basic <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
already has a blank content pane; you can either add things to that pane or you can replace the
basic content pane entirely.  In my sample program, the line
<span class="code">window.setContentPane(content)</span> replaces the original blank content pane with
a different component.  (Remember that a "component" is just a visual element of a graphical user interface).
In this case, the new content is a component of type <span class="classname">JPanel</span>.</p>


<p>
<span class="classname">JPanel</span> is another of the fundamental classes in Swing.  The basic <span class="classname">JPanel</span>
is, again, just a blank rectangle.  There are two ways to make a useful <span class="classname">JPanel</span>:
The first is to <b>add other components</b> to the panel; the second is to <b>draw something</b> in
the panel.  Both of these techniques are illustrated in the sample program. In fact, you will find two <span class="classname">JPanel</span>s
in the program:  <span class="code">content</span>, which is used to contain other components, and <span class="code">displayPanel</span>, which
is used as a drawing surface.</p>
   

<p>Let's look more closely at <span class="code">displayPanel</span>.  This variable is of type <span class="classname">HelloWorldDisplay</span>,
which is a nested static class inside the <span class="classname">HelloWorldGUI2</span> class.  (Nested classes were introduced
in <a href="../c5/s7.html#OOP.7.2">Subection&nbsp;5.7.2</a>.)  This class defines just one instance method, <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>, which
overrides a method of the same name in the <span class="classname">JPanel</span> class:</p>
   

<pre>private static class HelloWorldDisplay extends JPanel {
   public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
      super.paintComponent(g);
      g.drawString( "Hello World!", 20, 30 );
   }
}</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method is called by the system when a component needs to be painted
on the screen.  In the <span class="classname">JPanel</span> class, the <span class="code">paintComponent</span> method simply
fills the panel with the panel's background color.  The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method in
<span class="classname">HelloWorldDisplay</span> begins by calling <span class="code">super.paintComponent(g)</span>.  This
calls the version of <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> that is defined in the superclass, <span class="classname">JPanel</span>;
that is, it fills the panel with the background color.  (See <a href="../c5/s6.html#OOP.6.2">Subection&nbsp;5.6.2</a> for a discussion of the
special variable <span class="code">super</span>.)  Then it calls <span class="code">g.drawString()</span> to paint
the string "Hello World!" onto the panel.  The net result is that whenever a <span class="classname">HelloWorldDisplay</span>
is shown on the screen, it displays the string "Hello World!".</p>
   

<p>We will often use <span class="classname">JPanel</span>s in this way, as drawing surfaces.  Usually, when we do this,
we will define a nested class that is a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span> and we will write a <span class="code">paintComponent</span>
method in that class to draw the desired content in the panel.</p>
   

   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI1.1.2">6.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Components and Layout</a>
</h3>
   

<p>Another way of using a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> is as a <span class="newword">container</span>
to hold other components.  Java has many classes that define GUI components.  Before these
components can appear on the screen, they must be <span class="newword">added</span> to a container.  In this program,
the variable named <span class="code">content</span> refers to a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> that is
used as a container, and two other components are added to that container.  This is done in the
statements:</p>
   

<pre>content.add(displayPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
content.add(okButton, BorderLayout.SOUTH);</pre>


<p>Here, <span class="code">content</span> refers to an object of type <span class="classname">JPanel</span>;
later in the program, this panel becomes the content pane of the window.
The first component that is added to <span class="code">content</span> is <span class="code">displayPanel</span> which, as discussed above, displays
the message, "Hello World!".  The second is <span class="code">okButton</span> which represents the button that
the user clicks to close the window.  The variable
<span class="code">okButton</span> is of type <span class="classname">JButton</span>, the Java class that represents 
push buttons.</p>


<p>The "BorderLayout" stuff in these statements has to do with
how the two components are arranged in the container.  When components
are added to a container, there has to be some way of deciding how those components are arranged
inside the container.  This is called "laying out" the components in the container, and the
most common technique for laying out components is to use a <span class="newword">layout manager</span>.
A layout manager is an object that implements some policy for how to arrange the components
in a container; different types of layout manager implement different policies.  One type of
layout manager is defined by the <span class="classname">BorderLayout</span> class.  In the program, the
statement</p>
   

<pre>content.setLayout(new BorderLayout());</pre>
   

<p>creates a new <span class="classname">BorderLayout</span> object and tells the <span class="code">content</span>
panel to use the new object as its layout manager.  Essentially, this line determines how
components that are added to the content panel will be arranged inside the panel.  We will
cover layout managers in much more detail later, but for now all you need to know is
that adding <span class="code">okButton</span> in the <span class="code">BorderLayout.SOUTH</span> position puts
the button at the bottom of the panel, and putting <span class="code">displayPanel</span> in the
<span class="code">BorderLayout.CENTER</span> position makes it fill any space that is not taken
up by the button.</p>
   

<p>This example shows a general technique for setting up a GUI:  Create a container and
assign a layout manager to it, create components and add them to the container, and
use the container as the content pane of a window or applet. A container is itself a
component, so it is possible that some of the components that are added to the top-level
container are themselves containers, with their own layout managers and components.
This makes it possible to build up complex user interfaces in a hierarchical fashion,
with containers inside containers inside containers...</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI1.1.3">6.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Events and Listeners</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The structure of containers and components sets up the physical appearance of a
GUI, but it doesn't say anything about how the GUI <b>behaves</b>.  That is, what
can the user do to the GUI and how will it respond?  GUIs are largely
<span class="newword">event-driven</span>; that is, the program waits for events that are generated
by the user's actions (or by some other cause).  When an event occurs, the program
responds by executing an <span class="newword">event-handling method</span>.  In order to
program the behavior of a GUI, you have to write event-handling methods to respond
to the events that you are interested in.</p>
   

<p>The most common technique for handling events in Java is to use <span class="newword">event
listeners</span>.  A listener is an object that includes one or more event-handling
methods.  When an event is detected by another object, such as a button or menu,
the listener object is notified and it responds by running the appropriate event-handling
method.  An event is detected or generated by an object.  Another object, the listener,
has the responsibility of responding to the event.  The event itself is actually represented
by a third object, which carries information about the type of event, when it occurred,
and so on.  This division of responsibilities makes it easier to organize large programs.</p>
   

<p>As an example, consider the OK button in the sample program.  When the user
clicks the button, an event is generated.  This event is represented by an object belonging
to the class <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span>.  The event that is generated is associated
with the button; we say that the button is the <span class="newword">source</span> of the event.
The listener object in this case is an object belonging to the class <span class="classname">ButtonHandler</span>,
which is defined as a nested class inside <span class="classname">HelloWorldGUI2</span>:</p>


<pre>private static class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener {
   public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
      System.exit(0);
   }
}</pre>
   

<p>This class implements the <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> interface -- a requirement for
listener objects that handle events from buttons.  (Interfaces were introduced in 
<a href="../c5/s7.html#OOP.7.1">Subection&nbsp;5.7.1</a>.)  The event-handling method is named <span class="code">actionPerformed</span>,
as specified by the <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> interface.  This method contains the
code that is executed when the user clicks the button; in this case, the code is a call
to <span class="code">System.exit()</span>, which will terminate the program.</p>
   

<p>There is one more ingredient that is necessary to get the event from the button to the
listener object:  The listener object must <span class="newword">register</span> itself with the button
as an event listener.  This is done with the statement:</p>


<pre>okButton.addActionListener(listener);</pre>
   

<p>This statement tells <span class="code">okButton</span> that when the user clicks the button, the
ActionEvent that is generated should be sent to <span class="code">listener</span>.  Without this statement,
the button has no way of knowing that some other object would like to listen for events
from the button.</p>
   

<p>This example shows a general technique for programming the behavior of a GUI:
Write classes that include event-handling methods.  Create objects that belong to these
classes and register them as listeners with the objects that will actually detect or
generate the events.  When an event occurs, the listener is notified, and the code that you
wrote in one of its event-handling methods is executed.  At first, this might seem like
a very roundabout and complicated way to get things done, but as you gain experience
with it, you will find that it is very flexible and that it goes together very well with
object oriented programming.  (We will return to events and listeners in much more detail in
<a href="../c6/s3.html">Section&nbsp;6.3</a> and later sections, and I do not expect you to completely
understand them at this time.)</p>
