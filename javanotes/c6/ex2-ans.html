<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.2:</h3>
<p>Write a panel that shows a small red square and a small blue
square. The user should be able to drag either square with the mouse.
(You'll need an instance variable to remember which square the user is
dragging.) The user can drag the square off the applet if she wants; if she
does this, it's gone. Use your panel in either an applet or a stand-alone application.
You can try the applet version here:</p>
<p align="center">
<applet code="DragTwoSquaresApplet.class" width="260" height="160" archive="DragTwoSquares.jar" alt=""></applet></p>

<hr>
<p>To write this applet, you need to understand dragging, as discussed in
<a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.4">Subection&nbsp;6.4.4</a>. To support dragging, you have to implement
both the <span class="classname">MouseListener</span> and <span class="classname">MouseMotionListener</span> interfaces and
register some object to listen for both mouse and mouse motion events. The code
for dragging a square is spread out over three methods, <span class="code">mousePressed</span>,
<span class="code">mouseReleased</span>, and <span class="code">mouseDragged</span>. Several instance variables
are needed to keep track of what is going on while a dragging operation is
being executed. A general framework for dragging is given in <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.4">Subection&nbsp;6.4.4</a>. This
example is simplified a bit because while dragging the square, we only need to
know the current position of the mouse, so that we can move the square to that
position. We don't need to keep track of the previous position of the
mouse.  In my solution, I decided to write a nested class inside the panel class
to define the listening object.  Another possibility would have been to let
the panel class implement <span class="classname">MouseListener</span> and
<span class="classname">MouseMotionListener</span>, and then register the panel with
itself to listen for events.</p>


<p>As always for any implementation of dragging, I use a boolean variable,
<span class="code">dragging</span>, to keep track of whether or not a drag operation is in
progress. Not every mouse press starts a drag operation. If the use clicks the
applet outside of the squares, there is nothing to drag, and <span class="code">dragging</span>
is set to false in the <span class="code">mousePressed</span> method.  If the user clicks one 
of the squares, <span class="code">dragging</span> is set to true. Since there are two
squares to be dragged, we have to keep track of which is being dragged. I use a
boolean variable, <span class="code">dragRedSquare</span>, which is true if the red square is
being dragged and is false if the blue square is being dragged. (A boolean
variable is actually not the best choice in this case. It would be a problem if
we wanted to add another square. A boolean variable only has two possible
values, so an integer variable would probably be a better choice.) I keep track
of the locations of the squares with integer instance variables <span class="code">x1</span> and
<span class="code">y1</span> for the upper left corner of the red square and <span class="code">x2</span> and
<span class="code">y2</span> for the upper left corner of the blue square.  These variables
are in the main class, not the nested class that defines the listener, since the
panel needs to know the location of the squares when it paints itself.</p>


<p>There is one little problem. The mouse location is a single <span class="code">(x,y)</span>
point. A square occupies a whole bunch of points. When we move the square to
follow the mouse, where exactly should we put the square? One possibility is to
put the upper left corner of the square at the mouse location. If we did this,
the <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> routine would look like:</p>


<pre>public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt) { 
    if (dragging == false)  
      return;
    int x = evt.getX();  // Get mouse position.
    int y = evt.getY();
    if (dragRedSquare) {  // Move the red square.
       x1 = x;  // Put top-left corner at mouse position.
       y1 = y;
    }
    else {   // Move the blue square.
       x2 = x;  // Put top-left corner at mouse position.
       y2 = y;
    }
    repaint();
}</pre>


<p>This works, but it not very aesthetic. When the user starts dragging a
square, no matter where in the square the user clicks, the square will jump so
that its top-left corner is at the mouse position. This is not what a user
typically expects. If I grab a square by clicking its center, then I want the
center to stay under the mouse cursor as I move it. If I grab the lower right
corner, I want the lower right corner to follow the mouse, not the upper left
corner. There is a solution to this, and it's one that is often needed for
dragging operations. We need to record the original position of the mouse
relative to the upper left corner of the square. This tells us where in the
square the user clicked. This is done in the <span class="code">mousePressed</span> routine by
assigning appropriate values to instance variables <span class="code">offsetX</span> and
<span class="code">offsetY</span>:</p>


<pre>int x = evt.getX();  // Location where user clicked.
int y = evt.getY();

if (x &gt;= x2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; x2+30 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= y2 &amp;&amp; y &lt; y2+30) {
      // It's the blue square (which should be checked first,
      // since it's drawn on top of the red square.)
   dragging = true;
   dragRedSquare = false;
   offsetX = x - x2;  // Distance from corner of square to (x,y).
   offsetY = y - y2;
}
else if (x &gt;= x1 &amp;&amp; x &lt; x1+30 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= y1 &amp;&amp; y &lt; y1+30) {
      // It's the red square.
   dragging = true;
   dragRedSquare = true;
   offsetX = x - x1;  // Distance from corner of square to (x,y).
   offsetY = y - y1;
}</pre>


<p>In <span class="code">mouseDragged</span>, when the mouse moves to a new <span class="code">(x,y)</span>
point, we move the square so that the vertical and horizontal distances between
the mouse location and the top left corner of the square remain the same:</p>


<pre>if (dragRedSquare) {  // Move the red square.
   x1 = x - offsetX;  // Offset corner from mouse location.
   y1 = y - offsetY;
}
else {   // Move the blue square.
   x2 = x - offsetX;  // Offset corner from mouse location.
   y2 = y - offsetY;
}</pre>


<p>The main class is a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>.
The constructor in this class sets up the initial positions of the two
squares, creates a listening object, and registers the listening object to
listen for mouse and mouse motion events.  It also adds a border around the
panel to make it more attractive.  The only other thing in the main class
is a <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method, which just has to draw the two
squares in their current positions.  This is fairly easy to write.</p>


<p>All this leads to the complete source code, shown below, along wit a
simple applet class  that uses the panel as its content pane.</p>


<p>By the way, if you wanted to stop the user from dragging the square outside
the applet, you would just have to add code to the <span class="code">mouseDragged</span>
routine to "clamp" the variables <span class="code">x1</span>, <span class="code">y1</span>, <span class="code">x2</span>, and
<span class="code">y2</span> so that they lie in the acceptable range. Here is a modified
routine that keeps the square entirely within the applet:</p>


<pre>public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt) { 
    if (dragging == false)  
      return;
    int x = evt.getX();
    int y = evt.getY();
    if (dragRedSquare) {  // Move the red square.
       x1 = x - offsetX;
       y1 = y - offsetY;
       if (x1 &lt; 0)  // Clamp (x1,y1) so the square lies in the applet.
          x1 = 0;
       else if (x1 &gt;= getWidth() - 30)
          x1 = getWidth() - 30;
       if (y1 &lt; 0)
          y1 = 0;
       else if (y1 &gt;= getHeight() - 30)
          y1 = getHeight() - 30;
    }
    else {   // Move the blue square.
       x2 = x - offsetX;
       y2 = y - offsetY;
       if (x2 &lt; 0)  // Clamp (x2,y2) so the square lies in the applet.
          x2 = 0;
       else if (x2 &gt;= getWidth() - 30)
          x2 = getWidth() - 30;
       if (y2 &lt; 0)
          y2 = 0;
       else if (y2 &gt;= getHeight() - 30)
          y2 = getHeight() - 30;
    }
    repaint();
