<hr class="break">
   

<p>
<span class="start"><big>A</big>lthough stand-alone applications</span> are probably
more important than applets at this point in the history of Java, applets are
still widely used.  They can do things on Web pages that can't easily be done with
other technologies.  It is easy to distribute applets to users: The user just has
to open a Web page, and the applet is there, with no special installation required
(although the user must have an appropriate version of Java installed on their
computer).  And of course, applets are fun; now that the Web has become such a
common part of life, it's nice to be able to see your work running on a web
page.</p>


<p>The good news is that writing applets is not much different from writing
stand-alone applications.  The structure of an applet is essentially the same
as the structure of the <span class="classname">JFrame</span>s that were introduced
in the <a href="../c6/s1.html">previous section</a>, and events are
handled in the same way in both types of program.  So, most of what you
learn about applications applies to applets, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
   

<p>Of course, one difference is that an applet is dependent on a Web page,
so to use applets effectively, you have to learn at least a little about
creating Web pages.  Web pages are written using a language called <span class="newword">HTML</span>
(HyperText Markup Language).  In <a href="../c6/s2.html#GUI1.2.3">Subection&nbsp;6.2.3</a>, below, you'll learn how to use
HTML to create Web pages that display applets.</p>
   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI1.2.1">6.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;JApplet</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The <span class="classname">JApplet</span> class (in package <span class="code">javax.swing</span>) can be
used as a basis for writing applets in the same way that <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
is used for writing stand-alone applications.  The basic <span class="classname">JApplet</span>
class represents a blank rectangular area.  Since an applet is not a stand-alone
application, this area must appear on a Web page, or in some other environment that
knows how to display an applet.
Like a <span class="classname">JFrame</span>, a <span class="classname">JApplet</span> contains a content pane
(and can contain a menu bar).  You can add content to an applet either by adding
content to its content pane or by replacing the content pane with another component.
In my examples, I will generally create a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> and use it
as a replacement for the applet's content pane.</p>
   

<p>To create an applet, you will write a subclass of <span class="classname">JApplet</span>.
The <span class="classname">JApplet</span> class defines several instance methods that are
unique to applets.  These methods are called by the applet's environment at certain
points during the applet's "life cycle."  In the <span class="classname">JApplet</span> class
itself, these methods do nothing; you can override these methods in a subclass.
The most important of these special applet methods is</p>


<pre>public void init()</pre>
   

<p>An applet's <span class="code">init()</span> method is called when the applet is created.
You can use the <span class="code">init()</span> method as a place where you can set up the
physical structure of the applet and the event handling that will determine its
behavior.  (You can also do some initialization in the constructor for your class,
but there are certain aspects of the applet's environment that are set up after
its constructor is called but before the <span class="code">init()</span> method is called,
so there are a few operations that will work in the <span class="code">init()</span> method
but will not work in the constructor.)  The other applet life-cycle methods
are <span class="code">start()</span>, <span class="code">stop()</span>, and <span class="code">destroy()</span>.
I will not use these methods for the time being and will not discuss them here
except to mention that <span class="code">destroy()</span> is called at the end of the
applet's lifetime and can be used as a place to do any necessary cleanup,
such as closing any windows that were opened by the applet.</p>


<p>With this in mind, we can look at our first example of a <span class="classname">JApplet</span>.
It is, of course, an applet that says "Hello World!".  To make it a little more interesting,
I have added a button that changes the text of the message, and a state variable,
<span class="code">currentMessage</span> that holds the text of the current message.  This example is very
similar to the stand-alone application <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/HelloWorldGUI2.java">HelloWorldGUI2</a></span>
from the <a href="../c6/s1.html#GUI1.1.1">previous section</a>.  It uses an event-handling
class to respond when the user clicks the button, a panel to display
the message, and another panel that serves as a container for the message panel and the button.
The second panel becomes the content pane of the applet.  Here is the source code
for the applet; again, you are not expected to understand all the details at
this time:</p>
      

<pre>import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import javax.swing.*;

/**
 * A simple applet that can display the messages "Hello World"
 * and "Goodbye World".  The applet contains a button, and it
 * switches from one message to the other when the button is
 * clicked.
 */
public class HelloWorldApplet extends JApplet {
   
   private String currentMessage = "Hello World!"; // Currently displayed message.
   private MessageDisplay displayPanel;  // The panel where the message is displayed.
   
   private class MessageDisplay extends JPanel {   // Defines the display panel.
      public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
         super.paintComponent(g);
         g.drawString(currentMessage, 20, 30);
      }
   }
   
   private class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener {  // The event listener.
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
         if (currentMessage.equals("Hello World!"))
            currentMessage = "Goodbye World!";
         else
            currentMessage = "Hello World!";
         displayPanel.repaint(); // Paint display panel with new message.
      }
   }
   
   /**
    * The applet's init() method creates the button and display panel and
    * adds them to the applet, and it sets up a listener to respond to
    * clicks on the button.
    */
   public void init() {
      
      displayPanel = new MessageDisplay();
      JButton changeMessageButton = new JButton("Change Message");
      ButtonHandler listener = new ButtonHandler();
      changeMessageButton.addActionListener(listener);

      JPanel content = new JPanel();
      content.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
      content.add(displayPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
      content.add(changeMessageButton, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

      setContentPane(content);
   }
   
}</pre>
   

<p>You should compare this class with <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/HelloWorldGUI2.java">HelloWorldGUI2.java</a></span> from
the previous section.  One subtle difference that you will notice is that the
member variables and nested classes in this example are non-static.  Remember that
an applet is an object.  A single class can be used to make several applets,
and each of those applets will need its own copy of the applet data, so the
member variables in which the data is stored must be non-static instance
variables.  Since the variables are non-static, the two nested classes,
which use those variables, must also be non-static.  (Static nested classes
cannot access non-static member variables in the containing class;
see <a href="../c5/s7.html#OOP.7.2">Subection&nbsp;5.7.2</a>.)  Remember the basic rule for deciding whether to
make a nested class static: If it needs access to any instance variable or instance
method in the containing class, the nested class must be non-static; otherwise, it
can be declared to be <span class="code">static</span>.</p>



<p>You can try out the applet itself.  Click the "Change Message" button to switch the
message back and forth between "Hello World!" and "Goodbye World!":</p>

<p align="center">
<applet code="HelloWorldApplet.class" width="250" height="100" archive="HelloWorldApplet.jar" alt=""></applet></p>

   

   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI1.2.2">6.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Reusing Your JPanels</a>
</h3>
   

<p>Both applets and frames can be programmed in the same way:  Design a <span class="classname">JPanel</span>,
and use it to replace the default content pane in the applet or frame.  This makes it very
easy to write two versions of a program, one which runs as an applet and one which runs as
a frame.  The idea is to create a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span> that represents
the content pane for your program; all the hard programming work is done in this panel class.
An object of this class can then be used as the content pane either in a frame or in an applet.
Only a very simple <span class="code">main()</span> program is needed to show your panel in a frame,
and only a very simple applet class is needed to show your panel in an applet, so it's easy
to make both versions.</p>
   

<p>As an example, we can rewrite <span class="classname">HelloWorldApplet</span> by writing
a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>. That class can then be reused to make a frame
in a standalone application.  This class is very similar to
<span class="classname">HelloWorldApplet</span>, but now the initialization is done in
a constructor instead of in an <span class="code">init()</span> method:</p>
   

<pre>import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import javax.swing.*;

public class HelloWorldPanel extends JPanel {
   
   private String currentMessage = "Hello World!"; // Currently displayed message.
   private MessageDisplay displayPanel;  // The panel where the message is displayed.
   
   private class MessageDisplay extends JPanel {   // Defines the display panel.
      public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
         super.paintComponent(g);
         g.drawString(currentMessage, 20, 30);
      }
   }
   
   private class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener {  // The event listener.
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
         if (currentMessage.equals("Hello World!"))
            currentMessage = "Goodbye World!";
         else
            currentMessage = "Hello World!";
         displayPanel.repaint(); // Paint display panel with new message.
      }
   }
   
   /**
    * The constructor creates the components that will be contained inside this
    * panel, and then adds those components to this panel.
    */
   public HelloWorldPanel() {

      displayPanel = new MessageDisplay();  // Create the display subpanel.

      JButton changeMessageButton = new JButton("Change Message"); // The button.
      ButtonHandler listener = new ButtonHandler();
      changeMessageButton.addActionListener(listener);

      setLayout(new BorderLayout());  // Set the layout manager for this panel.
      add(displayPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);  // Add the display panel.
      add(changeMessageButton, BorderLayout.SOUTH);  // Add the button.

   }
   
}</pre>
   

<p>Once this class exists, it can be used in an applet.  The applet class only
has to create an object of type <span class="classname">HelloWorldPanel</span> and use
that object as its content pane:</p>
   

<pre>import javax.swing.JApplet;

public class HelloWorldApplet2 extends JApplet {
   public void init() {  
      HelloWorldPanel content = new HelloWorldPanel();
      setContentPane(content);
   }
}</pre>
   

<p>Similarly, its easy to make a frame that uses an object of type <span class="classname">HelloWorldPanel</span>
as its content pane:</p>
   

<pre>import javax.swing.JFrame;
   
public class HelloWorldGUI3 {
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      JFrame window = new JFrame("GUI Test");
      HelloWorldPanel content = new HelloWorldPanel();
      window.setContentPane(content);
      window.setSize(250,100);
      window.setLocation(100,100);
      window.setDefaultCloseOperation( JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE );
      window.setVisible(true);
   }
   
}</pre>


<p>One new feature of this example is the line</p>


<pre>window.setDefaultCloseOperation( JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE );</pre>
   

<p>This says that when the user closes the window by clicking the close box in the 
title bar of the window, the program should be terminated.  This is necessary because
no other way is provided to end the program.  Without this line, the default close
operation of the window would simply hide the window when the user clicks the close
box, leaving the program running.  This brings up one of the difficulties of reusing
the same panel class both in an applet and in a frame:  There are some things that
a stand-alone application can do that an applet can't do.  Terminating the program
is one of those things.  If an applet calls <span class="code">System.exit()</span>, it has
no effect except to generate an error.</p>
   

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of occasional minor difficulties, many of the GUI examples
in this book will be written as subclasses of <span class="classname">JPanel</span> that can
be used either in an applet or in a frame.</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI1.2.3">6.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic HTML</a>
</h3>
   

<p>Before you can actually use an applet that you have written, you need to create
a Web page on which to place the applet. Such pages are themselves written in a language
called <span class="newword">HTML</span> 
(HyperText Markup Language). An HTML document describes
the contents of a page. A Web browser interprets the HTML code to determine
what to display on the page. The HTML code doesn't look much like the resulting
page that appears in the browser. The HTML document does contain all the text
that appears on the page, but that text is "marked up" with commands that
determine the structure and appearance of the text and determine what will
appear on the page in addition to the text.</p>


<p>HTML has become a rather complicated language. In this section,
I will cover just the most basic aspects of the language. You can easily
find more information on the Web, if you want to learn more.
Although there are many Web-authoring
programs that make it possible to create Web pages without ever looking at the
underlying HTML code, it is possible to write an HTML page using an ordinary text editor, typing
in all the mark-up commands by hand, and it is worthwhile to learn how to create
at least simple pages in this way.</p>
   

<p>There is a strict syntax for HTML documents (although in practice Web browsers will do
their best to display a page even if it does not follow the syntax strictly).  Leaving out
optional features, an HTML document has the form:
</p>
   

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;<span class="bnf">document-title</span>&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
<span class="bnf">document-content</span>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
   

<p>The <span class="bnf">document-title</span> is text that will appear in the title bar of the Web
browser window when the page is displayed.  The <span class="bnf">document-content</span> is what is
displayed on the page itself.  The rest of this section describes some of the things
that can go into the <span class="bnf">document-content</span> section of an HTML document</p>
   

<hr class="break">
   

<p>The mark-up commands used by HTML are called <span class="newword">tags</span>.  Examples
include <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;title&gt;</span> in the document
outline given above.  An HTML tag takes the form</p>


<pre>&lt;<span class="bnf">tag-name</span>&nbsp; <span class="bnf">optional-modifiers</span>&gt;</pre>


<p>where the <span class="bnf">tag-name</span> is a word that specifies
the command, and the <span class="bnf">optional-modifiers</span>, if
present, are used to provide additional information for the command (much like
parameters in subroutines).   A modifier takes the form</p>


<pre>
<span class="bnf">modifier-name</span> = <span class="bnf">value</span>
</pre>


<p>Usually, the <span class="bnf">value</span> is enclosed in quotes,
and it must be if it is more than one word long or if it contains certain
special characters. There are a few modifiers which have no value, in which
case only the name of the modifier is present. HTML is case insensitive, which
means that you can use upper case and lower case letters interchangeably in tags
and modifiers.  (However, lower case is generally used because XHTML, a successor
language to HTML, requires lower case.)</p>


<p>A simple example of a tag is <span class="code">&lt;hr&gt;</span>, which draws a line -- also
called a "horizontal rule" -- across the page. The <span class="code">hr</span> tag can take
several possible modifiers such as <span class="code">width</span> and <span class="code">align</span>. For
example, a horizontal line that extends halfway across the page could be generated
with the tag:</p>


<pre>&lt;HR&nbsp; width="50%"&gt;</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">width</span> here is specified as <span class="code">50%</span> of the available space,
meaning a line that extends halfway across the page.
The width could also be given as a fixed number of pixels.</p>


<p>Many tags require matching closing tags, which take the form</p>


<pre>&lt;<b>/</b><span class="bnf">tag-name</span>&gt;</pre>


<p>For example, the <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span> tag at the beginning of an HTML document
must be matched by a closing <span class="code">&lt;/html&gt;</span> tag at the end of the document.
As another example, the tag <span class="code">&lt;pre&gt;</span> must always have a matching
closing tag <span class="code">&lt;/pre&gt;</span> later in the document. An opening/closing tag pair applies to
everything that comes between the opening tag and the closing tag. The
<span class="code">&lt;pre&gt;</span> tag tells a Web browser to display everything between the
<span class="code">&lt;pre&gt;</span> and the <span class="code">&lt;/pre&gt;</span> just as it is formatted in
the original HTML source code, including all the spaces and carriage returns.
(But tags between <span class="code">&lt;pre&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;/pre&gt;</span> are still
interpreted by the browser.) "Pre" stands for preformatted text.  All of the
sample programs in  this book are formatted using the
<span class="code">&lt;pre&gt;</span> command.</p>


<p>It is important for you to understand that when you don't use <span class="code">&lt;pre&gt;</span>,
the computer will completely ignore the formatting of the text in the HTML
source code. The only thing it pays attention to is the tags. Five blank lines
in the source code have no more effect than one blank line or even a single
blank space. Outside of <span class="code">&lt;pre&gt;</span>, if you want to force a new line
on the Web page, you can use the tag <span class="code">&lt;br&gt;</span>, which stands for
"break". For example, I might give my address as:</p>


<pre>David Eck&lt;br&gt;
Department of Mathematics and Computer Science&lt;br&gt;
Hobart and William Smith Colleges&lt;br&gt;
Geneva, NY 14456&lt;br&gt;</pre>


<p>If you want extra vertical space in your web page, you can use several
<span class="code">&lt;br&gt;</span>'s in a row.</p>


<p>Similarly, you need a tag to indicate how the text should be broken up into
paragraphs. This is done with the <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> tag, which should be
placed at the beginning of every paragraph. The <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> tag has a
matching <span class="code">&lt;/p&gt;</span>, which should be placed at the end of each
paragraph. The closing <span class="code">&lt;/p&gt;</span> is technically optional, but it is
considered good form to use it. If you want all the lines of the paragraph to
be shoved over to the right, you can use <span class="code">&lt;p&nbsp;align=right&gt;</span> instead
of <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>. (This is mostly useful when used with one short line, or
when used with <span class="code">&lt;br&gt;</span> to make several short lines.) You can also
use <span class="code">&lt;p&nbsp;align=center&gt;</span> for centered lines.</p>


<p>By the way, if tags like <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;hr&gt;</span> have
special meanings in HTML, you might wonder how one can get them to appear here on
this page.
To get certain special characters to appear on the page, you have to
use an <span class="newword">entity name</span> in the HTML source code. The
entity name for <span class="code">&lt;</span> is <span class="code">&amp;lt;</span>, and the entity name for
<span class="code">&gt;</span> is <span class="code">&amp;gt;</span>. Entity names begin with <span class="code">&amp;</span> and
end with a semicolon. The character <span class="code">&amp;</span> is itself a special
character whose entity name is <span class="code">&amp;amp;</span>. There are also entity names
for nonstandard characters such as an accented "e", which has the entity name
<span class="code">&amp;eacute;</span>.</p>

   

<p>There are several useful tags that change the appearance of text.  For example, to
get italic text, enclose the text between <span class="code">&lt;i&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;/i&gt;</span>.
For example,</p>
   

<pre>&lt;i&gt;Introduction to Programming using Java&lt;/i&gt;</pre>
   

<p>in an HTML document gives <i>Introduction to Programming using Java</i> in italics when
the document is displayed as a Web page.  Similarly, the tags <span class="code">&lt;b&gt;</span>,
<span class="code">&lt;u&gt;</span>, and <span class="code">&lt;tt&gt;</span> can be used for
<b>bold</b>, <u>underlined</u>, and <span class="code">typewriter-style</span> ("monospace") text.</p>
   

<p>A headline, with very large text, can be made placing the the text between <span class="code">&lt;h1&gt;</span>
and <span class="code">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>.  Headlines with smaller text can be made using
<span class="code">&lt;h2&gt;</span> or <span class="code">&lt;h3&gt;</span> instead of <span class="code">&lt;h1&gt;</span>.  Note
that these headline tags stand on their own; they are not use inside paragraphs.
You can add the modifier <span class="code">align=center</span> to center the headline, and you can
include break tags (<span class="code">&lt;br&gt;</span>) in a headline to break it up into multiple
lines.  For example, the following HTML code will produce a medium--sized, centered, two-line
headline:</p>


<pre>&lt;h2 align=center&gt;Chapter 6:&lt;br&gt;Introduction to GUI Programming&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>
   

<hr class="break">
   

<p>The most distinctive feature of HTML is that documents can contain
<span class="newword">links</span> to other documents. The user can follow
links from page to page and in the process visit pages from all over the
Internet.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">&lt;a&gt;</span> tag is used to create a link. The text between the
<span class="code">&lt;a&gt;</span> and its matching <span class="code">&lt;/a&gt;</span> appears on the page
as the text of the link; the user can follow the link
by clicking on this text. The <span class="code">&lt;a&gt;</span> tag uses the modifier
<span class="code">href</span> to say which document the link should connect to. The value for
<span class="code">href</span> must be a <span class="newword">URL</span> (Uniform Resource
Locator). A URL is a coded set of instructions for finding a document on the
Internet. For example, the URL for my own "home page" is</p>


<pre>http://math.hws.edu/eck/</pre>


<p>To make a link to this page, such as <a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/">David's Home Page</a>, 
I would use the HTML source code</p>


<pre>&lt;a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/"&gt;David's Home Page&lt;/a&gt;</pre>


<p>The best place to find URLs is on existing Web pages. Web browsers display
the URL for the page you are currently viewing, and they can display the URL of
a link if you point to the link with the mouse.</p>


<p>If you are writing an HTML document and you want to make a link to another
document that is in the same directory, you can use a <span class="newword">relative URL</span>. 
The relative URL consists of just the name of the file. For example,
to create a link to a file named "s1.html" in the same directory as the HTML document
that you are writing, you could use</p>


<pre>&lt;a href="s1.html"&gt;Section 1&lt;/a&gt;</pre>


<p>There are also relative URLs for linking to files that are in other
directories. Using relative URLs is a good idea, since if you use them, you can
move a whole collection of files without changing any of the links between them
(as long as you don't change the relative locations of the files).</p>


<p>When you type a URL into a Web browser, you can omit the "http://" at the
beginning of the URL. However, in an <span class="code">&lt;a&gt;</span> tag in an HTML
document, the "http://" can only be omitted if the URL is a relative URL. For a
normal URL, it is required.</p>


<hr class="break">
   

<p>You can add images to a Web page with the <span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag. (This is
a tag that has no matching closing tag.) The actual image must be stored in a
separate file from the HTML document. The <span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag has a
required modifier, named <span class="code">src</span>, to specify the URL of the image file.
For most browsers, the image should be in one of the formats PNG (with a file
name ending in ".png"), JPEG (with a file name ending in ".jpeg" or ".jpg"),
or GIF (with a file name ending in ".gif").  Usually, the
image is stored in the same place as the HTML document, and a relative URL -- that is,
just the name of the image file -- is used to specify the image file.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag also has several optional modifiers. It's a
good idea to always include the <span class="code">height</span> and <span class="code">width</span> modifiers,
which specify the size of the image in pixels. Some browsers handle images better
if they know in advance how big they are.
The <span class="code">align</span> modifier can be used to affect the placement of the
image: "align=right" will shove the image to the right edge of the page, and
the text on the page will flow around the image; "align=left" works similarly.
(Unfortunately, "align=center" doesn't have the meaning you would expect.
Browsers treat images as if they are just big characters. Images can occur
inside paragraphs, links, and headings, for example. Alignment values of
<span class="code">center</span>, <span class="code">top</span>, and <span class="code">bottom</span> are used to specify how the
image should line up with other characters in a line of text: Should the
baseline of the text be at the center, the top, or the bottom of the image?
Alignment values of <span class="code">right</span> and <span class="code">left</span> were added to HTML later,
but they are the most useful values.  If you want an image centered on the page,
put it inside a <span class="code">&lt;p&nbsp;align=center&gt;</span> tag.)</p>


<p>For example, here is HTML code that will place an image from a file named
figure1.png on the page.</p>


<pre>&lt;img src="figure1.png" align=right height=150 width=100&gt;</pre>


<p>The image is 100 pixels wide and 150 pixels high, and it will appear on the
right edge of the page.</p>

<a name="GUI1.2.4">6.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Applets on Web Pages</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The main point of this whole discussion of HTML is to learn how to use applets
on the Web.  The <span class="code">&lt;applet&gt;</span> tag can be used to add a Java applet to a Web page.
This tag must have a matching <span class="code">&lt;/applet&gt;</span>. A required modifier
named <span class="code">code</span> gives the name of the compiled class file that contains the
applet class. The modifiers <span class="code">height</span> and <span class="code">width</span> are required to specify
the size of the applet, in pixels. If you want the applet to be centered on the page, you
can put the applet in a paragraph with <span class="code">center</span> alignment So, an applet
tag to display an applet named <span class="code">HelloWorldApplet</span> centered on a Web page
would look like this:</p>


<pre>&lt;p align=center&gt; 
&lt;applet code="HelloWorldApplet.class" height=100 width=250&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>


<p>This assumes that the file <span class="code">HelloWorldApplet.class</span> is located in the same
directory with the HTML document.  If this is not the case, you can use another
modifier, <span class="code">codebase</span>, to give the URL of the directory that contains the
class file. The value of <span class="code">code</span> itself is always just a class, not a
URL.</p>


<p>If the applet uses other classes in addition to the applet class itself, then
those class files must be in the same directory as the applet class (always assuming
that your classes are all in the "default package"; see <a href="../c2/s6.html#basics.6.4">Subection&nbsp;2.6.4</a>).
If an applet requires more than one or two class files, it's a good idea to collect all the
class files into a single jar file.  Jar files are
"archive files" which hold a number of smaller files.
If your class files are in a jar archive, then you have to specify the
name of the jar file in an <span class="code">archive</span> modifier in the
<span class="code">&lt;applet&gt;</span> tag, as in</p>


<pre>&lt;applet code="HelloWorldApplet.class" archive="HelloWorld.jar" height=50...</pre>
   

<p>I will have more to say about creating and using jar files at the end of this chapter.</p> 


<p>Applets can use <span class="newword">applet parameters</span> to customize
their behavior. Applet parameters are specified by using <span class="code">&lt;param&gt;</span>
tags, which can only occur between an <span class="code">&lt;applet&gt;</span> tag and the
closing <span class="code">&lt;/applet&gt;</span>. The <span class="code">param</span> tag has required modifiers
named <span class="code">name</span> and <span class="code">value</span>, and it takes the form</p>


<pre>&lt;param  name="<span class="bnf">param-name</span>"  value="<span class="bnf">param-value</span>"&gt;</pre>


<p>The parameters are available to the applet when it runs. An applet can use
the predefined method <span class="code">getParameter()</span> to check for parameters specified
in <span class="code">param</span> tags. The <span class="code">getParameter()</span> method has the following
interface:</p>


<pre>String getParameter(String paramName)</pre>


<p>The parameter <span class="code">paramName</span> corresponds to the <span class="bnf">param-name</span> 
in a <span class="code">param</span> tag. If the specified
<span class="code">paramName</span> actually occurs in one of the <span class="code">param</span> tags, then
<span class="code">getParameter(paramName)</span> returns the associated <span class="bnf">param-value</span>. 
If the specified <span class="code">paramName</span> does not
occur in any <span class="code">param</span> tag, then <span class="code">getParameter(paramName)</span> returns the value
<span class="code">null</span>. Parameter names are case-sensitive, so you cannot use "size" in
the <span class="code">param</span> tag and ask for "Size" in <span class="code">getParameter</span>.
The <span class="code">getParameter()</span> method is often called in the applet's <span class="code">init()</span>
method.  It will not work correctly in the applet's constructor, since it depends on information
about the applet's environment that is not available when the constructor is called.</p>



<p>Here is an example of an <span class="code">applet</span> tag with several <span class="code">params</span>:</p>


<pre>
      &lt;applet code="ShowMessage.class" width=200 height=50&gt;
         &lt;param name="message" value="Goodbye World!"&gt;
         &lt;param name="font" value="Serif"&gt;
         &lt;param name="size" value="36"&gt;
      &lt;/applet&gt;
</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">ShowMessage</span> applet would presumably read these parameters in
its <span class="code">init()</span> method, which could go something like this:</p>


<pre>String message;  // Instance variable: message to be displayed.
String fontName; // Instance variable: font to use for display.
int fontSize;    // Instance variable: size of the display font.
 
public void init() {
    String value;
    value = getParameter("message"); // Get message param, if any.
    if (value == null)
       message = "Hello World!";  // Default value, if no param is present.
    else
       message = value;  // Value from PARAM tag.
    value = getParameter("font");
    if (value == null)
       fontName = "SansSerif";  // Default value, if no param is present.
    else
       fontName = value;
    value = getParameter("size");
    try {
       fontSize = Integer.parseInt(value);  // Convert string to number.
    }
    catch (NumberFormatException e) {
       fontSize = 20; // Default value, if no param is present, or if
    }                 //   the parameter value is not a legal integer.
     .
     .
     .</pre>


<p>Elsewhere in the applet, the instance variables <span class="code">message</span>, <span class="code">fontName</span>,
and <span class="code">fontSize</span> would be used to determine the message displayed by the applet and
the appearance of that message.  Note that the value returned by <span class="code">getParameter()</span>
is always a <span class="classname">String</span>.  If the <span class="code">param</span> represents a numerical
value, the string must be converted into a number, as is done here for
the <span class="code">size</span> parameter.</p>
