<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;1:</span></td><td>
<p>Programs written for a
graphical user interface have to deal with "events." Explain what is meant by
the term <i>event.</i> Give at least two different examples of events, and
discuss how a program might respond to those events.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p> An event is anything that can
occur asynchronously, not under the control of the program, to which the
program might want to respond. GUI programs are said to be "event-driven"
because for the most part, such programs simply wait for events and respond to
them when they occur. In many (but not all) cases, an event is the result of a
user action, such as when the user clicks the mouse button, types a character,
or clicks a button. The program might respond to a mouse-click on a canvas by
drawing a shape, to a typed character by adding the character to an input box,
or to a click on a button by clearing a drawing. More generally, a programmer
can set up any desired response to an event by writing an event-handling
routine for that event.</p>

<p>Explain carefully what the
<span class="code">repaint()</span> method does.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>The <span class="code">repaint()</span> method of a component is
called to notify the system that the component
needs to be redrawn. It does not itself do any drawing (neither
directly nor by calling the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
routine). You should call <span class="code">repaint()</span> when you have made some change to
the state of the applet that requires its appearance to change. Sometime
shortly after you call it, the system will call 
the component's <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> routine.</p>

<p>What is HTML?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup
Language, is a language that is used for writing Web pages. An HTML document
contains all the text on a Web page, "marked up" with "tags" that determine how
the text looks -- its size and color and how it is broken into paragraphs, for
example. Other tags can include things like horizontal lines, images, links,
and applets on the page. A Web browser acts as an interpreter for the HTML
language.</p>

<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;4:</span></td><td>
<p>Java has a standard class
called <span class="classname">JPanel</span>. Discuss <b>two</b> ways in which JPanels can be
used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p> A JPanel is a type of component.
That is, it is a visible element of a GUI. By itself, a JPanel is simply a
blank rectangular region on the screen. However, a JPanel is a "container",
which means that other components can be added to it and will then appear on
the screen inside the JPanel. A JPanel can also be used as a drawing surface.
In order to do this, it is necessary to create a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>
and define a <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method in that subclass. An object
belonging to that subclass can then be added to another panel or other container.
The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method defines how that object will draw itself
on the screen.</p>

<p>Draw the picture that will
be produced by the following <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method:</p>

<pre>public static void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
    super.paintComponent(g);
    for (int i=10; i &lt;= 210; i = i + 50)
       for (int j = 10; j &lt;= 210; j = j + 50)
          g.drawLine(i,10,j,60);
}</pre>

<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>The outer loop is executed for
values of <span class="code">i</span> equal to 10, 60, 110, 160, and 210. For <b>each</b> of
these values, the inner loop is executed for <span class="code">j</span> equal to 10, 60, 110,
160, and 210. The <span class="code">drawLine</span> command is therefore executed 25 times --
and so, 25 different lines are drawn. These lines connect the five points
(10,10), (60,10), (110,10), (160,10), and (210,10) to the five points (10,60),
(60,60), (110,60), (160,60), and (210,60) in all possible pairings. Here is the

<p>(The size of the square and
circle are not specified in the problem, so any size would be acceptable, as
long as the square is in the middle of the circle. Notice that the drawing
commands are <span class="code">fillOval</span> and <span class="code">fillRect</span>. There are no special
routines for drawing circles or squares.)</p>

<pre>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
   super.paintComponent(g);

<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;7:</span></td><td>
<p>Java has a standard class
called <span class="classname">MouseEvent</span>. What is the purpose of this class? What does an
object of type <span class="classname">MouseEvent</span> do?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>When an event occurs, the system
packages information about the event into an object. That object is passed as a
parameter to the event-handling routine. Different types of events are
represented by different classes of objects. An object of type
<span class="code">MouseEvent</span> represents a mouse or mouse motion event. It contains
information about the location of the mouse cursor and any modifier keys that
the user is holding down. This information can be obtained by calling the
instance methods of the object. For example, if <span class="code">evt</span> is a
<span class="code">MouseEvent</span> object, then <span class="code">evt.getX()</span> is the
<span class="code">x</span>-coordinate of the mouse cursor, and <span class="code">evt.isShiftDown()</span> is a
boolean value that tells you whether the user was holding down the Shift
key.</p>

<p>One of the main classes in
Swing is the <span class="classname">JComponent</span> class. What is meant by a component? What are
some examples?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p> A <span class="classname">JComponent</span> represents
a visual component of the computer's graphical user interface. A
<span class="classname">JComponent</span> is not completely independent. It must be added to a
"container," such as a panel. Examples of <span class="classname">JComponents</span> are
<span class="classname">JButtons</span>, <span class="classname">JTextFields</span>, and <span class="classname">JPanels</span>.</p>

<p> What is the function of a
<span class="classname">LayoutManager</span> in Java?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>A <span class="classname">LayoutManager</span>
implements some policy for laying out all the visual components that have been
added to a container, such as a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> or the content pane of a
<span class="classname">JApplet</span>. That is, it sets the sizes and positions of the components.
Different types of layout managers have different rules about how components
are to be arranged. Some standard layout manager classes are
<span class="classname">BorderLayout</span> and <span class="classname">GridLayout</span>.</p>
</td>

<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;10:</span></td><td>
<p>What type of layout manager is being used for each of the three panels

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>The main panel, shown in blue, seems to be using a <span class="classname">GridLayout</span>
with two rows and one column.  A <span class="classname">GridLayout</span> is most likely
since the two components in the main panel -- the other two panels -- are
exactly the same size.  Similarly, the bottom subpanel, shown in green, seems to
be using a <span class="classname">GridLayout</span> with one row and three columns.
The top subpanel, shown in red, could be using a <span class="classname">BorderLayout</span>.
The components on the left and right ends of the subpanel would be in the
<span class="code">WEST</span> and <span class="code">EAST</span> positions of the <span class="classname">BorderLayout</span>.
Each of these components would then be shown at its own preferred width, which would
explain how their widths could be different.  The third component, in the center
of the subpanel, would then be in the <span class="code">CENTER</span> position.</p>

<p>Explain how <span class="classname">Timers</span>
are used to do animation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>Displaying an animation requires
showing a sequence of frames. The frames are shown one after the other, with a
short delay between each frame and the next. A <span class="classname">Timer</span> can generate a
sequence of <span class="classname">ActionEvents</span>. When a timer is used to do animation, each
event triggers the display of another frame. The <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> that
processes events from the timer just needs to be programmed to display a new frame
each time its <span class="classname">actionPerformed()</span> method is called.</p>

<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;12:</span></td><td>
<p>What is a <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span>
and how is it used?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>A <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> is a
component that has two possible states, "selected" and "not selected". The user can
change the state by clicking on the <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span>. If <span class="code">box</span> is a
variable of type <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span>, then a program can set the state of the box 
to "selected" by
calling <span class="code">box.setSelected(true)</span> and can unselect the box by calling
<span class="code">box.setSelected(false)</span>. The current state can be determined by calling
<span class="code">box.isSelected()</span>, which is a boolean-valued function. A
<span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> generates an event of type <span class="code">ActionEvent</span> when it
changes state. A program can listen for these events if it wants to take some
action at the time the state changes. Often, however, it's enough for a program
simply to look at the state of the <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> when it needs it.</p>
