<h2>Solution for Programmming Exercise 6.9</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.9:</h3>
<p>Write a Blackjack program
that lets the user play a game of Blackjack, with the computer as the dealer.
The applet should draw the user's cards and the dealer's cards, just as was
done for the graphical HighLow card game in  <a href="../c6/s7.html#GUI1.7.6">Subection&nbsp;6.7.6</a>.
You can use the source code for that game, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/HighLowGUI.java">HighLowGUI.java</a></span>, for some ideas about how to
write your Blackjack game. The structures of the HighLow panel and the
Blackjack panel are very similar. You will certainly want to use the
<span class="code">drawCard()</span> method from the HighLow program.</p>


<p>You can find a description of the game of Blackjack in <a href="../c5/ex5-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.5</a>. 
Add the following rule to that
description: If a player takes five cards without going over 21, that player
wins immediately. This rule is used in some casinos. For your program, it means
that you only have to allow room for five cards. You should assume that the
panel is just wide enough to show five cards, and that it is tall enough 
show the user's hand and the dealer's hand.</p>


<p>Note that the design of a GUI Blackjack game is very different from the
design of the text-oriented program that you wrote for <a href="../c5/ex5-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.5</a>. The user
should play the game by clicking on "Hit" and "Stand" buttons. There should be
a "New Game" button that can be used to start another game after one game ends.
You have to decide what happens when each of these buttons is pressed. You
don't have much chance of getting this right unless you think in terms of the
states that the game can be in and how the state can change.</p>


<p>Your program will need the classes defined in 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Card.java">Card.java</a></span>,
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Hand.java">Hand.java</a></span>,
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Deck.java">Deck.java</a></span>, and
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/BlackjackHand.java">BlackjackHand.java</a></span>.</p>



<p>Here is an applet version of the program for you to try:</p>

<p align="center">
<applet code="BlackjackGUI$Applet.class" width="466" height="346" archive="BlackjackGUI.jar" alt=""></applet></p>

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>The constructor for this exercise can be almost identical to that in
the <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/HighLowGUI.java">HighLow</a></span> game.  The text of the buttons
just has to be changed from "Higher" and "Lower" to "Hit" and "Stand".  However,
the nested class, <span class="classname">CardPanel</span> has to be rewritten to
implement a game of Blackjack instead of a game of HighLow. The basic structure
of the revised class remains similar to the original.
All the programming for the game is in this class.</p>


<p>In the HighLow game, there is one "hand," which holds all the cards that
have been dealt. Blackjack is a two-player game, so there are two hands, one
for the player and one for the dealer. These hands are of type
<span class="code">BlackjackHand</span>. So, we need instance variables</p>


<pre>BlackjackHand dealerHand;   // The dealer's cards.
BlackjackHand playerHand;   // The user's cards.</pre>


<p>We also need a <span class="code">deck</span> and a boolean-valued instance variable,
<span class="code">gameInProgress</span>, to keep track of the two basic states of the game: Is
a game in progress, or are we between games. Finally, there is a
<span class="code">message</span> variable, which holds the string that is shown at the bottom
of the game board.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method uses the information in the
<span class="code">dealerHand</span>, <span class="code">playerHand</span>, <span class="code">message</span>, and
<span class="code">gameInProgress</span> variables. The reason it needs to look at the
<span class="code">gameInProgress</span> variable is that when a game is in progress, one of the
dealer's cards is drawn face down, so the user can't see it. Once the game is
over, the card is drawn face up so the user can see what the dealer was
holding. Note that there is no point in the program where I say, "turn the
dealer's first card face up"! It happens automatically because the state of the
game changes, and the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method checks the state when it
draws the applet. If the game is over, the card is face up. If the game is in
progress, the card is face down. This is nice
example of state-machine thinking.</p>


<p>Note that writing the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method required some
calculation. The cards are 80 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall. Horizontally,
there is a gap of 10 pixels between cards, and there are gaps of 10 pixels
between the cards and the left and right edges. (The total width needed for the
card panel, 460, allows for five 80-pixel cards and six 10-pixel gaps:
 5*80 + 6*10  = 460.  The applet is another 6 pixels wide because of a 3-pixel wide
border on each side). The <span class="code">N</span>-th card,
counting from 0, has its left edge at <span class="code">10+90*N</span>. It might be easier to
see this as <span class="code">10+80*N+10*N</span>, 10 pixels on the left plus <span class="code">N</span>
80-pixel cards, plus <span class="code">N</span> 10-pixel gaps between cards. Vertically, I
allow 30 pixels for each string, "Dealer's Cards" and "Your Cards". This puts
the top of the first row of cards at <span class="code">y=30</span>. Allowing 100 pixels for
that row of cards and 30 pixels for the string "Your Cards", the top of the
second row of cards is at 160. Given all this, you should be able to understand
the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method. Allowing 100 pixels for the second row of
cards and 30 pixels for the message at the bottom of the board, we need a
height of at least 290 pixels for the canvas. I set the preferred height of the panel to
310 to for some extra space between the cards and the message at the bottom of the
panel.  The applet has an even greater height to allow for the height of the
button bar below the card panel.</p>


<p>In this GUI version of Blackjack, things happen when the user clicks the
"Hit", "Stand", and "New Game" buttons. The program handles these events by
calling the routines <span class="code">doHit()</span>, <span class="code">doStand()</span>, and
<span class="code">doNewGame()</span>. Each of these routines has responsibility for one part of
the game of Blackjack. Note that each routine starts by checking the state of
the game to make sure that it is legal to call the routine at this time. If
<span class="code">gameInProgress</span> is true, the user can legally click "Hit" or "Stand".
If <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> is false, the user can legally click "New Game". If
the user made an illegal move, an error message is stored in the
<span class="code">message</span> variable, and <span class="code">repaint()</span> is called so the user will
see the new message. This is similar to the way the three buttons in HighLowGUI
are handled.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">doNewGame()</span> routine has to set up a new game. This means
creating the deck and hands, shuffling the deck and dealing two cards into each
hand. At this point, the first time I wrote the game, I just set
<span class="code">gameInProgress</span> to true, to record the fact that the state of the game
has changed. Later, I realized that the <span class="code">doNewGame()</span> routine also has
to check whether one of the players has Blackjack, since there is really no
other place where this can be done. If one of the players has Blackjack, the
game is over as soon as it starts, so <span class="code">gameIsProgress</span> has to be false, and the only action
that the user can take at that point is to click the "New Game" button again.
(Note that the <span class="code">doNewGame()</span> routine is also called by the constructor
of the <span class="code">BlackjackPanel</span> class. This sets up the first game, when the
panel is first created, so the user doesn't have to click on the "New Game"
button to start the first game.)</p>


<p>When the user clicks "Hit", if the game is in progress, we deal a card into
the user's hand. At this point, the state of the game might have changed. If
the user has over 21, the user loses and the game is over. If the user has
taken 5 cards without going over 21, the user wins and the game is over. In
either of these cases, the value of the state variable <span class="code">gameInProgress</span>
becomes <span class="code">false</span>. Otherwise, <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> retains the value
<span class="code">true</span>, and the game will continue. Since <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> is
<span class="code">true</span>, the user again still the choice of clicking "Hit" or "Stand".
(Note that there is no loop in the program that says "while the user continues
to hit." The progress of the game is driven by events.)</p>


<p>Finally, when the user clicks "Stand", the game is definitely over, so
<span class="code">gameInProgrss</span> is set to false. However, before the game can end, the
dealer gets to draw cards and a winner is determined. This all has to be done
in the <span class="code">doStand()</span> routine. Then, the applet is repainted to show the
final state of the game.</p>
