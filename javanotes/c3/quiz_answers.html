<p>What is an <i>algorithm</i>?</p>
</td>

<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>An algorithm is an unambiguous, step-by-step procedure for performing
a certain task, which is guaranteed to finish after a finite number of steps.
(An algorithm is not the same thing as a program, but it can be the <i>idea</i>
behind a program.)</p>

<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;2:</span></td><td>
<p>Explain briefly what is
meant by "pseudocode" and how is it useful in the development of
algorithms.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>Pseudocode refers to informal
descriptions of algorithms, written in a language that imitates the structure
of a programming language, but without the strict syntax. Pseudocode can be
used in the process of developing an algorithm with stepwise refinement. You
can start with a brief pseudocode description of the algorithm and then add
detail to the description through a series of refinements until you have
something that can be translated easily into a program written in an actual
programming language.</p>

<p>What is a <i>block
statement?</i> How are block statements used in Java programs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>A block statement is just a
sequence of Java statements enclosed between braces, { and }. The body of a
subroutine is a block statement. Block statements are often used in control
structures. A block statement is generally used to group together several
statements so that they can be used in a situation that only calls for a single
statement. For example, the syntax of a while loop calls for a single
statement: "while (condition) do statement". However, the statement can be a
block statement, giving the structure: "while (condition) { statement;
statement;&nbsp;...}".</p>

<p>What is the main difference
between a <span class="code">while</span> loop and a <span class="code">do..while</span> loop?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>Both types of loop repeat a
block of statements until some condition becomes false. The main difference is
that in a <span class="code">while</span> loop, the condition is tested at the beginning of the
loop, and in a <span class="code">do..while</span> loop, the condition is tested at the end of
the loop. It is possible that the body of a <span class="code">while</span> loop might not be
executed at all. However, the body of a <span class="code">do..while</span> loop is executed at
least once since the condition for ending the loop is not tested until the body
of the loop has been executed.</p>

<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;5:</span></td><td>
<p>What does it mean to
<i>prime</i> a loop?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>The condition at the beginning
of a while loop has to make sense even the first time it is tested, before the
body of the loop is executed. To prime the loop is to set things up before the
loop starts so that the test makes sense (that is, the variables that it
contains have reasonable values). For example, if the test in the loop is
"while the user's response is yes," then you will have to prime the loop by
getting a response from the user (or making one up) before the loop.</p>

<p>Explain what is meant by an
<i>animation</i> and how a computer displays an animation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>An animation consists of a
series of "frames." Each frame is a still image, but there are slight
differences from one frame to the next. When the images are displayed rapidly
one frame after another, the eye perceives motion. A computer displays an
animation by showing one image on the screen, then replacing it with the next
image, then the next, and so on.</p>

of values of type <span class="ptype">int</span>.  Write a code segment that will compute and print

<p>The function <span class="code">Integer.parseInt</span> can be used to convert the strings
into integers.  This function will throw an exception of type <span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span>
if the conversion fails.  A <span class="code">try..catch</span> exception can catch this exception and
print an error message.  So, the code segment can be written:</p>

<pre>try {
   int n1, n2;  // The values of s1 and s2 as integers.
   int sum;     // The sum of n1 and n2.
   n1 = Integer.parseInt(s1);

each time through the loop. For the final execution of the loop, N starts out
with the value 32, but N is doubled to 64 before it is printed.)</p>

<p>What output is produced by
the following program segment? <b>Why?</b> (Recall that <span class="code">name.charAt(i)</span>

<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>This is a tough one! The output
from this program consists of the three lines:</p>

<pre>    R
    M
    N</pre>

<p>As the <span class="code">for</span> loop in this code segment is executed,
<span class="code">name.charAt(i)</span> represents each of the characters in the string
"Richard M. Nixon" in succession. The statement
<span class="code">System.out.println(name.charAt(i))</span> outputs the single character
<span class="code">name.charAt(i)</span> on a line by itself. However, this output statement
occurs inside an <span class="code">if</span> statement, so only some of the characters are
output. The character is output if <span class="code">startWord</span> is true. This variable is
initialized to true, so when <span class="code">i</span> is 0, startWord is true, and the first
character in the string, 'R', is output. Then, since 'R' does not equal ' ',
<span class="code">startWorld</span> becomes false, so no more characters are output until
<span class="code">startWord</span> becomes true again. This happens when
<span class="code">name.charAt(i)</span> is a space, that is, just <i>before</i> the 'M' is
processed and again just before the 'N' is processed. In fact whatever the
value of <span class="code">name</span>, this <span class="code">for</span> statement would print the first
character in <span class="code">name</span> and every character in <span class="code">name</span> that follows a
space. (It is <i>almost</i> true that this for statement prints the first
character of each word in the string, but something goes wrong when there are
two spaces in a row. What happens in this case?)
