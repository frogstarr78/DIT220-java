<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> several exercises for Chapter 3
        in <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.  For each exercise, a link to
        a possible solution is provided.   Each solution includes a discussion of how a programmer might approach the
        problem and interesting points raised by the problem or its solution, as well as complete source
        code of the solution.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.1:</h3>
<p>How many times do you have
to roll a pair of dice before they come up snake eyes? You could do the
experiment by rolling the dice by hand. Write a computer program that simulates
the experiment. The program should report the number of rolls that it makes
before the dice come up snake eyes. (Note: "Snake eyes" means that both dice
show a value of 1.) <a href="../c2/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;2.2</a> explained how to simulate rolling a pair of dice.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.2:</h3>
<p>Which integer between 1
and 10000 has the largest number of divisors, and how many divisors does it
have? Write a program to find the answers and print out the results. It is
possible that several integers in this range have the same, maximum number of
divisors. Your program only has to print out one of them.
<a href="../c3/s4.html#control.4.2">Subection&nbsp;3.4.2</a> discussed divisors. The source code for
that example is <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/CountDivisors.java">CountDivisors.java</a></span>.</p>


<p>You might need some hints about how to find a maximum value. The basic idea
is to go through all the integers, keeping track of the largest number of
divisors that you've seen <i>so far</i>. Also, keep track of the integer that
had that number of divisors.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.3:</h3>
<p>Write a program that will
evaluate simple expressions such as 17 + 3 and 3.14159 * 4.7. The expressions
are to be typed in by the user. The input always consist of a number, followed
by an operator, followed by another number. The operators that are allowed are
+, -, *, and /. You can read the numbers with <span class="code">TextIO.getDouble()</span> and
the operator with <span class="code">TextIO.getChar()</span>. Your program should read an
expression, print its value, read another expression, print its value, and so
on. The program should end when the user enters 0 as the first number on the
line.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.4:</h3>
<p>Write a program that reads
one line of input text and breaks it up into words. The words should be output
one per line. A word is defined to be a sequence of letters. Any characters in
the input that are not letters should be discarded. For example, if the user
inputs the line</p>


<pre>He said, "That's not a good idea."</pre>


<p>then the output of the program should be</p>


<pre>He
said
that
s
not
a
good
idea</pre>


<p>An improved version of the program would list "that's" as a single word. An
apostrophe can be considered to be part of a word if there is a letter on each
side of the apostrophe.</p>


<p>To test whether a character is a letter, you might use <span class="code">(ch &gt;= 'a'
&amp;&amp; ch &lt;= 'z') || (ch &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; ch &lt;= 'Z')</span>.
However, this only works in English and similar languages. A better choice is
to call the standard function <span class="code">Character.isLetter(ch)</span>, which returns a
boolean value of <span class="code">true</span> if <span class="code">ch</span> is a letter and <span class="code">false</span> if
it is not. This works for any Unicode character.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.5:</h3>
<p>Suppose that a file contains information about sales figures for a company in various cities.
Each line of the file contains a city name, followed by a colon&nbsp;(:) followed by the data for that
city.  The data is a number of type <span class="ptype">double.</span>
However, for some cities, no data was available.  In these lines, the data is replaced by
a comment explaining why the data is missing.  For example, several lines from the file might
look like:</p>

<pre>San Francisco:  19887.32
Chicago:  no report received
New York: 298734.12</pre>

<p>Write a program that will compute and print the total sales from all the cities together. The
program should also report the number of cities for which data was not available.  The name of the
file is "sales.dat".</p>

<p>To complete this program, you'll need one fact about file input with <span class="classname">TextIO</span>
that was not covered in <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.5">Subection&nbsp;2.4.5</a>.  Since you don't know in advance how many
lines there are in the file, you need a way to tell when you have gotten to the end of the file.
When <span class="classname">TextIO</span> is reading from a file, the function <span class="code">TextIO.eof()</span>
can be used to test for <span class="newword">end of file</span>.  This <span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued
function returns <span class="code">true</span> if the file has been entirely read and returns <span class="code">false</span>
if there is more data to read in the file.  This means that you can read the lines of the
file in a loop <span class="code">while&nbsp;(TextIO.eof()&nbsp;==&nbsp;false)...</span>. The loop will end
when all the lines of the file have been read.</p>

<p>Suggestion:  For each line, read and ignore characters up to the colon.  Then read the rest
of the line into a variable of type <span class="classname">String</span>.  Try to convert the string
into a number, and use <span class="code">try..catch</span> to test whether the conversion succeeds.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.6:</h3>
<p>Write an applet that draws
a checkerboard. Assume that the size of the applet is 160 by 160 pixels. Each
square in the checkerboard is 20 by 20 pixels. The checkerboard contains 8 rows
of squares and 8 columns. The squares are red and black. Here is a tricky way
to determine whether a given square is red or black: If the row number and the
column number are either both even or both odd, then the square is red.
Otherwise, it is black. Note that a square is just a rectangle in which the
height is equal to the width, so you can use the subroutine
<span class="code">g.fillRect()</span> to draw the squares. Here is an image of the
checkerboard:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="checkerboard.gif" width="170" height="169" alt="checkerboard"></p>


<p>(To run an applet, you need a Web page to display it. A very simple page
will do. Assume that your applet class is called <span class="code">Checkerboard</span>, so that
when you compile it you get a class file named <span class="code">Checkerboard.class</span> Make
a file that contains only the lines:</p>


<pre>&lt;applet code="Checkerboard.class" width=160 height=160&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;</pre>


<p>Call this file <span class="code">Checkerboard.html</span>. This is the source code for a
simple Web page that shows nothing but your applet. You can open the file in a
Web browser or with Sun's appletviewer program. The compiled class file,
<span class="code">Checkerboard.class</span>, must be in the same directory with the Web-page
file, <span class="code">Checkerboard.html</span>.</p>

<p>(If you are using the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment, you can
simply right-click the name of the source code file in the Package Explorer.
In the pop-up menu, go to "Run&nbsp;As" then to "Java Applet".  This will open
the window in which the applet appears.  The default size for the window
is bigger than 160-by-160, so the drawing of the checkerboard will not fill the
entire window.)</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.7:</h3>
<p>Write an animation applet
that shows a checkerboard pattern in which the even numbered rows slide to the
left while the odd numbered rows slide to the right. You can assume that the
applet is 160 by 160 pixels. Each row should be offset from its usual position
by the amount <span class="code">getFrameNumber() % 40</span>. Hints: Anything you draw outside
the boundaries of the applet will be invisible, so you can draw more than 8
squares in a row. You can use negative values of x in
<span class="code">g.fillRect(x,y,w,h)</span>. Here is a working solution to this exercise:
</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="SlidingCheckerboard.class" width="160" height="160" alt=""></applet></p>


<p>Your applet will extend the non-standard class,
<span class="classname">SimpleAnimationApplet2</span>, which was introduced in 
<a href="../c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>. The compiled class files,
<span class="code">SimpleAnimationApplet2.class</span> and
<span class="code">SimpleAnimationApplet2$1.class</span>, must be in the same directory as your
Web-page source file along with the compiled class file for your own class. These
files are produced when you compile <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SimpleAnimationApplet2.java">SimpleAnimationApplet2.java</a></span>.
Assuming that the name of your class is <span class="code">SlidingCheckerboard</span>, then the
source file for the Web page should contain the lines:</p>


<pre>&lt;applet code="SlidingCheckerboard.class" width=160 height=160&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;</pre>
