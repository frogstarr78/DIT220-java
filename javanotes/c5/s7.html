<p>
<big>T</big>HIS SECTION simply pulls together a few more
miscellaneous features of object oriented programming in Java. Read it now, or
just look through it and refer back to it later when you need this
material.   (You will need to know about the first topic,
interfaces, almost as soon as we begin GUI programming.)</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.7.1">5.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Interfaces</a>
</h3>



<p>Some object-oriented programming languages, such as C++, allow a class to
extend two or more superclasses. This is called <span class="newword">multiple inheritance</span>. 
In the illustration below, for example, class&nbsp;E is shown as
having both class&nbsp;A and class&nbsp;B as direct superclasses, while class&nbsp;F has three
direct superclasses.</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="multipleInheritance.png" width="293" height="248" alt=""></p>
   

<p>Such multiple inheritance is <b>not</b> allowed in Java. The
designers of Java wanted to keep the language reasonably simple, and felt that
the benefits of multiple inheritance were not worth the cost in increased
complexity. However, Java does have a feature that can be used to accomplish
many of the same goals as multiple inheritance: <span class="newword">interfaces</span>.</p>


<p>We've encountered the term "interface" before, in connection with black
boxes in general and subroutines in particular. The interface of a subroutine
consists of the name of the subroutine, its return type, and the number and
types of its parameters. This is the information you need to know if you want
to call the subroutine. A subroutine also has an implementation: the block of
code which defines it and which is executed when the subroutine is called.</p>


<p>In Java, <span class="code">interface</span> is a reserved word with an additional, technical
meaning. An "<span class="code">interface</span>" in this sense consists of a set of instance method
interfaces, without any associated implementations.  (Actually, a Java interface
can contain other things as well, but we won't discuss them here.)
A class can <span class="newword">implement</span> 
an <span class="code">interface</span> by providing an implementation
for each of the methods specified by the interface. Here is an example of a
very simple Java <span class="code">interface</span>:</p>


<pre>public interface Drawable {
   public void draw(Graphics g);
}</pre>


<p>This looks much like a class definition, except that the implementation of
the <span class="code">draw()</span> method is omitted. A class that implements the
<span class="code">interface</span> <span class="classname">Drawable</span> must provide an implementation for this
method. Of course, the class can also include other methods and variables. For
example,</p>


<pre>public class Line implements Drawable {
    public void draw(Graphics g) {
        . . . // do something -- presumably, draw a line
    }
    . . . // other methods and variables
}</pre>


<p>Note that to implement an interface, a class must do more than simply provide
an implementation for each method in the interface; it must also <b>state</b> that
it implements the interface, using the reserved word <span class="code">implements</span> as
in this example: "public class Line <b>implements</b> Drawable".
Any class that implements the <span class="classname">Drawable</span> interface defines a
<span class="code">draw()</span> instance method. Any object created from such a class includes
a <span class="code">draw()</span> method. We say that an <b>object</b> implements an
<span class="code">interface</span> if it belongs to a class that implements the interface. For
example, any object of type <span class="classname">Line</span> implements the <span class="classname">Drawable</span>
interface.</p>


<p>While a class can <b>extend</b> only one other class, it can
<b>implement</b> any number of interfaces. In fact, a class can both extend
one other class and implement one or more interfaces.  So, we can have things
like</p>


<pre>class FilledCircle extends Circle 
                        implements Drawable, Fillable {
   . . .
}</pre>


<p>The point of all this is that, although interfaces are not classes, they are
something very similar. An interface is very much like an abstract class, that
is, a class that can never be used for constructing objects, but can be used as
a basis for making subclasses. The subroutines in an interface are abstract
methods, which must be implemented in any concrete class that implements the
interface. And as with abstract classes, even though you can't construct an
object from an interface, you can declare a variable whose type is given by the
interface. For example, if <span class="classname">Drawable</span> is an interface, and if
<span class="classname">Line</span> and <span class="classname">FilledCircle</span> are classes that implement
<span class="classname">Drawable</span>, then you could say:</p>


<pre>Drawable figure;  // Declare a variable of type Drawable.  It can
                  //    refer to any object that implements the
                  //    Drawable interface.
                  
figure = new Line();  // figure now refers to an object of class Line
figure.draw(g);   // calls draw() method from class Line

figure = new FilledCircle();   // Now, figure refers to an object
                               //   of class FilledCircle.
figure.draw(g);   // calls draw() method from class FilledCircle</pre>


<p>A variable of type <span class="classname">Drawable</span> can refer to any object of any class
that implements the <span class="classname">Drawable</span> interface. A statement like
<span class="code">figure.draw(g)</span>, above, is legal because <span class="code">figure</span> is of type
<span class="classname">Drawable</span>, and <b>any</b> <span class="classname">Drawable</span> object has a <span class="code">draw()</span>
method.  So, whatever object <span class="code">figure</span> refers to, that object must
have a <span class="code">draw()</span> method.</p>


<p>Note that a <span class="newword">type</span> is something that can be used
to declare variables. A type can also be used to specify the type of a
parameter in a subroutine, or the return type of a function. In Java, a type
can be either a class, an interface, or one of the eight built-in primitive
types. These are the only possibilities. Of these, however, only classes can be
used to construct new objects.</p>


<p>You are not likely to need to write your own interfaces until you get to the
point of writing fairly complex programs. However, there are a few interfaces
that are used in important ways in Java's standard packages. You'll learn about
some of these standard interfaces in the next few chapters.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.7.2">5.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Nested Classes</a>
</h3>


<p>A class seems like it should be a pretty important thing. A class is a
high-level building block of a program, representing a potentially complex idea
and its associated data and behaviors. I've always felt a bit silly writing
tiny little classes that exist only to group a few scraps of data together.
However, such trivial classes are often useful and even essential. Fortunately,
in Java, I can ease the embarrassment, because one class can be nested inside
another class. My trivial little class doesn't have to stand on its own. It
becomes part of a larger more respectable class. This is particularly useful
when you want to create a little class specifically to support the work of a
larger class. And, more seriously, there are other good reasons for nesting the
definition of one class inside another class.</p>


<p>In Java, a <span class="newword">nested class</span> is any class whose definition is inside the
definition of another class. Nested classes can be either <span class="newword">named</span> 
or <span class="newword">anonymous</span>. I will come
back to the topic of anonymous classes later in this section.  A named nested
class, like most other things that occur in classes, can be either static or
non-static.</p>
   

<p>The definition of a static nested looks just like the definition of any other class,
except that it is nested inside another class and it has the modifier <span class="code">static</span>
as part of its declaration. A static nested class is part of the static structure of the
containing class. It can be used inside that class to create objects in the
usual way. If it has not been declared private, then it can also be used
outside the containing class, but when it is used outside the class, its name
must indicate its membership in the containing class. This is similar to other
static components of a class: A static nested class is part of the class itself
in the same way that static member variables are parts of the class itself.</p>


<p>For example, suppose a class named <span class="classname">WireFrameModel</span> represents a set
of lines in three-dimensional space. (Such models are used to represent
three-dimensional objects in graphics programs.) Suppose that the
<span class="classname">WireFrameModel</span> class contains a static nested class, <span class="classname">Line</span>,
that represents a single line. Then, outside of the class
<span class="classname">WireFrameModel</span>, the <span class="classname">Line</span> class would be referred to as
<span class="code">WireFrameModel.Line</span>. Of course, this just follows the normal naming
convention for static members of a class. The definition of the
<span class="classname">WireFrameModel</span> class with its nested <span class="classname">Line</span> class would look,
in outline, like this:</p>


<pre>public class WireFrameModel {

   . . . // other members of the WireFrameModel class
   
   static public class Line {
         // Represents a line from the point (x1,y1,z1)
         // to the point (x2,y2,z2) in 3-dimensional space.
      double x1, y1, z1;
      double x2, y2, z2;
   } // end class Line
   
   . . . // other members of the WireFrameModel class
   
} // end WireFrameModel</pre>


<p>Inside the <span class="classname">WireFrameModel</span> class, a <span class="classname">Line</span> object would be
created with the constructor "<span class="code">new Line()</span>". Outside the class, "<span class="code">new
WireFrameModel.Line()</span>" would be used.</p>


<p>A static nested class has full access to the static members of the containing
class, even to the private members. Similarly, the containing class has full
access to the members of the nested class.  This can be another motivation for
declaring a nested class, since it lets you give one class access to the
private members of another class without making those members generally
available to other classes.</p>


<p>When you compile the above class definition, two class files will be
created. Even though the definition of <span class="classname">Line</span> is nested inside
<span class="classname">WireFrameModel</span>, the compiled <span class="classname">Line</span> class is stored in a
separate file. The name of the class file for <span class="classname">Line</span> will be
<span class="code">WireFrameModel$Line.class</span>.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Non-static nested classes are referred to as <span class="newword">inner classes</span>.
Inner classes are not, in practice, very different from static
nested classes, but a non-static nested class is actually associated with an
object rather than to the class in which it is nested. This can take some
getting used to.</p>


<p>Any non-static member of a class is not really part of the class itself
(although its source code is contained in the class definition). This is true
for inner classes, just as it is for any other non-static part of a
class. The non-static members of a class specify what will be contained in
objects that are created from that class. The same is true -- at least
logically -- for inner classes. It's as if each object that belongs
to the containing class has its <b>own copy</b> of the nested class. This copy
has access to all the instance methods and instance variables of the object,
even to those that are declared <span class="code">private</span>.
The two copies of the inner class in two different objects differ because the instance
variables and methods they refer to are in different objects. In fact, the rule
for deciding whether a nested class should be static or non-static is simple:
If the nested class needs to use any instance variable or instance method, make it
non-static. Otherwise, it might as well be static.</p>


<p>From outside the containing class, a non-static nested class has to be
referred to using a name of the form <span class="bnf">variableName</span>.<span class="bnf">NestedClassName</span>,
where <span class="bnf">variableName</span> is a variable that refers to the object that
contains the class. This is actually rather rare, however. A non-static nested
class is generally used only inside the class in which it is nested, and there
it can be referred to by its simple name.</p>


<p>In order to create an object that belongs to an inner class, you
must first have an object that belongs to the containing class. (When working
inside the class, the object "<span class="code">this</span>" is used implicitly.) The
inner class object is permanently associated with the containing class object, and it
has complete access to the members of the containing class object. Looking at
an example will help, and will hopefully convince you that inner
classes are really very natural. Consider a class that represents poker games.
This class might include a nested class to represent the players of the game.
This structure of the <span class="classname">PokerGame</span> class could be:</p>


<pre>public class PokerGame {  // Represents a game of poker.
    
    private class Player {  // Represents one of the players in <u>this</u> game.
       .
       .
       .
    } // end class Player
    
    private Deck deck;      // A deck of cards for playing the game.
    private int pot;        // The amount of money that has been bet.
    
    .
    .
    .

} // end class PokerGame</pre>


<p>If <span class="code">game</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">PokerGame</span>, then,
conceptually, <span class="code">game</span> contains its own copy of the <span class="classname">Player</span> class.
In an an instance method of a <span class="classname">PokerGame</span> object, a new <span class="classname">Player</span>
object would be created by saying "<span class="code">new Player()</span>", just as for any
other class. (A <span class="classname">Player</span> object could be created outside the
<span class="classname">PokerGame</span> class with an expression such as 
"<span class="code">game.new&nbsp;Player()</span>".  Again, however, this is very rare.)
The <span class="classname">Player</span>
object will have access to the <span class="code">deck</span> and <span class="code">pot</span> instance
variables in the <span class="classname">PokerGame</span> object. Each <span class="code">PokerGame</span> object has
its own <span class="code">deck</span> and <span class="code">pot</span> and <span class="code">Players</span>. Players of that
poker game use the deck and pot for that game; players of another poker game use
the other game's deck and pot. That's the effect of making the <span class="classname">Player</span>
class non-static. This is the most natural way for players to behave. A
<span class="classname">Player</span> object represents a player of one particular poker game. If
<span class="classname">Player</span> were a <b>static</b> nested class, on the other hand,
it would represent the general idea of a poker player, independent of a
particular poker game.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.7.3">5.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous Inner Classes</a>
</h3>


<p>In some cases, you might find yourself writing an inner class and then using
that class in just a single line of your program. Is it worth creating such a
class? Indeed, it can be, but for cases like this you have the option of using
an <span class="newword">anonymous inner class</span>. An anonymous class is
created with a variation of the <span class="code">new</span> operator that has the form</p>


<pre>
          new  <span class="bnf">superclass-or-interface</span> ( <span class="bnf">parameter-list</span> ) {
                   <span class="bnf">methods-and-variables</span>
              }
</pre>


<p>This constructor defines a new class, without giving it a name, and it
simultaneously creates an object that belongs to that class. This form of the
<span class="code">new</span> operator can be used in any statement where a regular
"<span class="code">new</span>" could be used. The intention of this expression is to create: "a
new object belonging to a class that is the same as <span class="bnf">superclass-or-interface</span> 
but with these <span class="bnf">methods-and-variables</span> added." 
The effect is to create a uniquely customized object, just at the point in the program where you need it.
Note that it is possible to base an anonymous class on an interface, rather
than a class. In this case, the anonymous class must implement the interface by
defining all the methods that are declared in the interface.  If an interface
is used as a base, the <span class="bnf">parameter-list</span> is empty.  Otherwise, it contains
parameters for a constructor in the <span class="bnf">superclass</span>.</p>


<p>Anonymous classes are  often used for handling events in graphical user
interfaces, and we will encounter them several times in the chapters on GUI programming.
For now, we will look at one not-very-plausible example. Consider the
<span class="classname">Drawable</span> interface, which is defined earlier in this section. Suppose
that we want a <span class="classname">Drawable</span> object that draws a filled, red, 100-pixel
square. Rather than defining a new, separate class and then using that class to
create the object, we can use an anonymous class to create the object in one
statement:</p>


<pre>Drawable redSquare = new Drawable() {
       void draw(Graphics g) {
          g.setColor(Color.red);
          g.fillRect(10,10,100,100);
       }
};</pre>


<p>The semicolon at the end of this statement is not part of the class
definition. It's the semicolon that is required at the end of every declaration
statement.</p>


<p>When a Java class is compiled, each anonymous nested class will produce a
separate class file. If the name of the main class is <span class="code">MainClass</span>, for
example, then the names of the class files for the anonymous nested classes
will be <span class="code">MainClass$1.class</span>, <span class="code">MainClass$2.class</span>,
<span class="code">MainClass$3.class</span>, and so on.</p>


   


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.7.4">5.7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixing Static and Non-static</a>
</h3>


<p>Classes, as I've said, have two very distinct purposes. A class can be used
to group together a set of static member variables and static member
subroutines. Or it can be used as a factory for making objects. The non-static
variables and subroutines in the class definition specify the
instance variables and methods of the objects. In most cases, a class performs
one or the other of these roles, not both.</p>


<p>Sometimes, however, static and non-static members are mixed in a single
class. In this case, the class plays a dual role. Sometimes, these roles are
completely separate. It is also possible for the static and non-static parts of
a class to interact. This happens when instance methods use static member
variables or call static member subroutines. An instance method belongs to an
object, not to the class itself, and there can be many objects with their own
versions of the instance method. But there is only one copy of a static member
variable. So, effectively, we have many objects sharing that one variable.</p>


<p>Suppose, for example, that we want to write a <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class that
uses the <span class="classname">Random</span> class mentioned in <a href="../c5/s3.html">Section&nbsp;5.3</a> for
rolling the dice. To do this, a <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> object needs access to an
object of type <span class="classname">Random</span>. But there is no need for each
<span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> object to have a separate <span class="classname">Random</span> object. (In fact,
it would not even be a good idea: Because of the way random number generators
work, a program should, in general, use only one source of random numbers.) A
nice solution is to have a single <span class="classname">Random</span> variable as a <span class="code">static</span>
member of the <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class, so that it can be shared by all
<span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> objects. For example:</p>


<pre>import java.util.Random;
 
 public class PairOfDice {
 
    <span class="newcode">private static Random randGen = new Random();</span>
    
    public int die1;   // Number showing on the first die.
    public int die2;   // Number showing on the second die.
    
    public PairOfDice() {
            // Constructor.  Creates a pair of dice that
            // initially shows random values.
         roll();
    }
   
    public void roll() {
            // Roll the dice by setting each of the dice to be
            // a random number between 1 and 6.
         die1 = randGen.nextInt(6) + 1;
         die2 = randGen.nextInt(6) + 1;
    }
    
} // end class PairOfDice</pre>


<p>As another example, let's rewrite the <span class="classname">Student</span> class that was used
in <a href="../c5/s2.html">Section&nbsp;5.2</a>. I've added an <span class="code">ID</span> for each
student and a <span class="code">static</span> member called <span class="code">nextUniqueID</span>. Although
there is an <span class="code">ID</span> variable in each student object, there is only one
<span class="code">nextUniqueID</span> variable.</p>


<pre>public class Student {

   private String name;  // Student's name.
   private int ID;  // Unique ID number for this student.
   public double test1, test2, test3;   // Grades on three tests.
   
   private static int nextUniqueID = 0;
             // keep track of next available unique ID number
   
   Student(String theName) {
        // Constructor for Student objects; provides a name for the Student,
        // and assigns the student a unique ID number.
      name = theName;
      nextUniqueID++;
      ID = nextUniqueID;
   }
   
   public String getName() {
        // Accessor method for reading value of private
        // instance variable, name.
      return name;
   }
   
   public int getID() {
        // Accessor method for reading value of ID.
      return ID;
   }
   
   public double getAverage() {  
        // Compute average test grade.
      return (test1 + test2 + test3) / 3;
   }
   
}  // end of class Student</pre>


<p>The initialization "<span class="code">nextUniqueID = 0</span>" is done only once, when the
class is first loaded. Whenever a <span class="classname">Student</span> object is constructed and
the constructor says "<span class="code">nextUniqueID++;</span>", it's always the same static
member variable that is being incremented. When the very first <span class="classname">Student</span>
object is created, <span class="code">nextUniqueID</span> becomes 1. When the second object is
created, <span class="code">nextUniqueID</span> becomes 2. After the third object, it becomes 3.
And so on. The constructor stores the new value of <span class="code">nextUniqueID</span> in the
<span class="code">ID</span> variable of the object that is being created. Of course,
<span class="code">ID</span> is an instance variable, so every object has its own individual
<span class="code">ID</span> variable. The class is constructed so that each student will
automatically get a different value for its <span class="code">ID</span> variable. Furthermore,
the <span class="code">ID</span> variable is <span class="code">private</span>, so there is no way for this
variable to be tampered with after the object has been created. You are
guaranteed, just by the way the class is designed, that every student object
will have its own permanent, unique identification number. Which is kind of
cool if you think about it.</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.7.5">5.7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Static Import</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The <span class="code">import</span> directive makes it possible to refer to a class
such as <span class="code">java.awt.Color</span> using its simple name, <span class="classname">Color</span>.
All you have to do is say <span class="code">import java.awt.Color</span> or <span class="code">import java.awt.*</span>.
But you still have to use compound names to refer to static member variables such
as <span class="code">System.out</span> and to static methods such as <span class="code">Math.sqrt</span>.</p>
   

<p>Java 5.0 introduced a new form of the <span class="code">import</span> directive that can
be used to import <span class="code">static</span> members of a class in the same way that
the ordinary <span class="code">import</span> directive imports classes from a package.
The new form of the directive is called a <span class="newword">static import</span>,
and it has syntax</p>
   

<pre>import static <span class="bnf">package-name</span>.<span class="bnf">class-name</span>.<span class="bnf">static-member-name</span>;</pre>
   

<p>to import one static member name from a class, or</p>
   

<pre>import static <span class="bnf">package-name</span>.<span class="bnf">class-name</span>.*;</pre>
   

<p>to import all the public static members from a class.  For example, if you preface
a class definition with</p>
   

<pre>import static java.lang.System.out;</pre>
   

<p>then you can use the simple name <span class="code">out</span> instead of the compound name <span class="code">System.out</span>.
This means you can use <span class="code">out.println</span> instead of <span class="code">System.out.println</span>.  If you
are going to work extensively with the <span class="classname">Math</span> class, you can preface
your class definition with</p>
   

<pre>import static java.lang.Math.*;</pre>
   

<p>This would allow to say <span class="code">sqrt</span> instead of <span class="code">Math.sqrt</span>, <span class="code">log</span>
instead of <span class="code">Math.log</span>, <span class="code">PI</span> instead of <span class="code">Math.PI</span>, and so on.</p>


<p>Note that the static import directive requires a <span class="bnf">package-name</span>, even for classes in
the standard package <span class="code">java.lang</span>.  One consequence of this is that you can't do a 
static import from a class in the default package.  In particular, it is not possible to do
a static import from my <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class -- if you wanted to do that,
you would have to move <span class="classname">TextIO</span> into a package.</p>

<a name="OOP.7.6">5.7.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Enums as Classes</a>
</h3>
   

<p>Enumerated types were introduced in <a href="../c2/s3.html#basics.3.3">Subection&nbsp;2.3.3</a>.  Now that we have
covered more material on classes and objects, we can revisit the topic (although still not
covering enumerated types in their full complexity).</p>


<p>Enumerated types are actually classes, and each enumerated type constant is a <span class="code">pubic</span>, <span class="code">final</span>,
<span class="code">static</span> member variable in that class (even though they are not declared with these modifiers).
The value of the variable is an object belonging to the enumerated type class.  There is one
such object for each enumerated type constant, and these are the only objects of the class that
can ever be created.  It is really these objects that represent the possible values of
the enumerated types.  The enumerated type constants are actually variables that refer
to these objects.</p>


<p>When an enumerated type is defined inside another class, it is a nested class inside the
enclosing class.  In fact, it is a static nested class, whether you declare it to
be <span class="code">static</span> or not.  But it can also be declared as a non-nested class, in a file
of its own.  For example, we could define the following enumerated type in a file
named <span class="code">Suit.java</span>:</p>
   

<pre>public enum Suit {
   
   SPADES, HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS
   
}</pre>


<p>This enumerated type represents the four possible suits for a playing card, and it could
have been used in the example <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Card.java">Card.java</a></span> from <a href="../c5/s4.html#OOP.4.2">Subection&nbsp;5.4.2</a>.</p>
   

<p>Furthermore, in addition to its list of values, an enumerated type can contain some of the 
other things that a regular class can contain, including methods and additional member variables.
Just add a semicolon (;) at the end of the list of values, and then add definitions of
the methods and variables in the usual way.  For example, we might make an enumerated type
to represent the possible values of a playing card.  It might be useful to have a method
that returns the corresponding value in the game of Blackjack.  As another example, suppose
that when we print out one of the values, we'd like to see something different from the
default string representation (the identifier that names the constant).  In that case, we can override 
the <span class="code">toString()</span> method in the
class to print out  a different string representation.  This would gives something like:</p>
   

<pre>public enum CardValue {

   ACE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT,
         NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING;
   
   /**
    * Return the value of this CardValue in the game of Blackjack.
    * Note that the value returned for an ace is 1.
    */
   public int blackJackValue() {
      if (this == JACK || this == QUEEN || this == KING)
         return 10;
      else
         return 1 + ordinal();
   }
   
   /**
    * Return a String representation of this CardValue, using numbers
    * for the numerical cards and names for the ace and face cards.
    */
   public String toString() {
      switch (this) {       // "this" is one of the enumerated type values
      case ACE:             // ordinal number of ACE
         return "Ace";
      case JACK:            // ordinal number of JACK
         return "Jack";
      case QUEEN:            // ordinal number of QUEEN
         return "Queen";
      case KING:            // ordinal number of KING
         return "King";
      default:            // it's a numeric card value
         int numericValue = 1 + ordinal();
      return "" + numericValue;     
   }

} // end CardValue</pre>
   

<p>The methods <span class="code">blackjackValue()</span> and <span class="code">toString()</span> are instance methods
in <span class="classname">CardValue</span>.  Since <span class="code">CardValue.JACK</span> is an object belonging
to that class, you can call <span class="code">CardValue.JACK.blackjackValue()</span>.
Suppose that <span class="code">cardVal</span> is declared to be a variable of type <span class="classname">CardValue</span>,
so that it can refer to any of the values in the enumerated type.
We can call <span class="code">cardVal.blackjackValue()</span> to find the Blackjack value of the <span class="classname">CardValue</span>
object to which <span class="code">cardVal</span> refers, and <span class="code">System.out.println(cardVal)</span> will
implicitly call the method <span class="code">cardVal.toString()</span> to obtain the print representation of
that <span class="classname">CardValue</span>. (One other thing to keep in mind is that since <span class="classname">CardValue</span>
is a class, the value of <span class="code">cardVal</span> can be <span class="code">null</span>, which means it does not refer
to any object.)</p>
   

<p>Remember that <span class="code">ACE</span>, <span class="code">TWO</span>, ..., <span class="code">KING</span> are the only possible
objects of type <span class="classname">CardValue</span>, so in an instance methods in that class,
<span class="code">this</span> will refer to one of those values.  Recall that the instance method <span class="code">ordinal()</span>
is defined in any enumerated type and gives the position of the enumerated type value in the list
of possible values, with counting starting from zero.</p>
   

<p>(If you find it annoying to use the class name as part of the name of every enumerated type constant,
you can use static import to make the simple names of the constants directly available -- but
only if you put the enumerated type into a package.  For example, if the enumerated type
<span class="classname">CardValue</span> is defined in a package named <span class="code">cardgames</span>, then you could place</p>
   

<pre>import static cardgames.CardValue.*;</pre>
   

<p>at the beginning of a source code file.  This would allow you, for example, to use the name
<span class="code">JACK</span> in that file instead of <span class="code">CardValue.JACK</span>.)</p>
