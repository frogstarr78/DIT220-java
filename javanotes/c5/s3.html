<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>here are several ways</span> in which object-oriented
concepts can be applied to the process of designing and writing programs. The
broadest of these is <span class="newword">object-oriented analysis and design</span> 
which applies an object-oriented methodology to the earliest
stages of program development, during which the overall design of a program is
created. Here, the idea is to identify things in the problem domain that can be
modeled as objects. On another level, object-oriented programming encourages
programmers to produce <span class="newword">generalized software components</span> 
that can be used in a wide variety of programming projects.</p>
   
   

<p>Of course, for the most part, you will experience "generalized software
components" by using the standard classes that come along with Java.  We begin
this section by looking at some built-in classes that are used for creating
objects.  At the end of the section, we will get back to generalities.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.3.1">5.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Built-in Classes</a>
</h3>


<p>Although the focus of object-oriented programming is generally on the design
and implementation of new classes, it's important not to forget that the
designers of Java have already provided a large number of reusable classes.
Some of these classes are meant to be extended to produce new classes, while
others can be used directly to create useful objects. A true mastery of Java
requires familiarity with a large number of built-in classes -- something that
takes a lot of time and experience to develop. In the <a href="../c6/index.html">next chapter</a>,
we will begin the study of Java's GUI
classes, and you will encounter other built-in classes throughout the remainder
of this book. But let's take a moment to look at a few built-in classes that
you might find useful.</p>


<p>A string can be built up from smaller pieces using the <span class="code">+</span> operator,
but this is not very efficient. If <span class="code">str</span> is a <span class="classname">String</span> and
<span class="code">ch</span> is a character, then executing the command
"<span class="code">str&nbsp;= str&nbsp;+&nbsp;ch;</span>" involves creating a whole new
string that is a copy of <span class="code">str</span>, with the value of <span class="code">ch</span> appended
onto the end. Copying the string takes some time. Building up a long string
letter by letter would require a surprising amount of processing. The class
<span class="classname">StringBuffer</span> makes it possible to be efficient about
building up a long string from a number of smaller pieces.  To do this,
you must make an object belonging to the <span class="classname">StringBuffer</span>
class.  For example:</p>
   

<pre>StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer();</pre>
   

<p>(This statement both declares the variable <span class="code">buffer</span> and initializes
it to refer to a newly created <span class="classname">StringBuffer</span> object.  Combining
declaration with initialization was covered in <a href="../c4/s7.html#subroutines.7.1">Subection&nbsp;4.7.1</a> and works
for objects just as it does for primitive types.)</p> 
   
 
<p>Like a <span class="classname">String</span>, a <span class="classname">StringBuffer</span> 
contains a sequence of characters.
However, it is possible to add new characters onto the end of a
<span class="code">StringBuffer</span> without making a copy of the data that it already
contains. If
<span class="code">x</span> is a value of any type and <span class="code">buffer</span> is the variable
defined above, then the command <span class="code">buffer.append(x)</span>
will add <span class="code">x</span>, converted into a string representation, onto the end of
the data that was already in the buffer. This command actually modifies the
buffer, rather than making a copy, and that can be done efficiently. A long
string can be built up in a <span class="classname">StringBuffer</span> using a sequence of
<span class="code">append()</span> commands. When the string is complete, the function
<span class="code">buffer.toString()</span> will return a copy of the string in the buffer as an
ordinary value of type <span class="classname">String</span>. The <span class="classname">StringBuffer</span>
class is in the standard package <span class="code">java.lang</span>, so you can use its simple name without
importing it.</p>


<p>A number of useful classes are collected in the package <span class="code">java.util</span>.
For example, this package contains classes for working with collections of
objects.  We will study these collection classes in <a href="futurelink">Chapter 10</a>.
Another class in this package, <span class="code">java.util.Date</span>, is
used to represent times. When a <span class="code">Date</span> object is constructed without
parameters, the result represents the current date and time, so an easy way to
display this information is:</p>


<pre>System.out.println( new Date() );</pre>


<p>Of course, to use the <span class="code">Date</span> class in this way, you must make it
available by importing it with one of the statements
"<span class="code">import&nbsp;java.util.Date;</span>" or "<span class="code">import&nbsp;java.util.*;</span>"
at the beginning of your program. (See <a href="../c4/s5.html#subroutines.5.3">Subection&nbsp;4.5.3</a>
for a discussion of packages and <span class="code">import</span>.)</p>


<p>I will also mention the class <span class="code">java.util.Random</span>. An object
belonging to this class is a <i>source</i> of random numbers (or, more precisely
pseudorandom numbers).  The standard
function <span class="code">Math.random()</span> uses one of these objects behind the scenes to
generate its random numbers. An object of type <span class="code">Random</span> can generate
random integers, as well as random real numbers. If <span class="code">randGen</span> is created
with the command:</p>


<pre>Random randGen = new Random();</pre>


<p>and if <span class="code">N</span> is a positive integer, then <span class="code">randGen.nextInt(N)</span>
generates a random integer in the range from <span class="code">0</span> to <span class="code">N-1</span>. For
example, this makes it a little easier to roll a pair of dice. Instead of
saying "<span class="code">die1&nbsp;= (int)(6*Math.random())+1;</span>", one can say
"<span class="code">die1&nbsp;= randGen.nextInt(6)+1;</span>". (Since you also have to
import the class <span class="code">java.util.Random</span> and create the <span class="code">Random</span>
object, you might not agree that it is actually easier.)  An object of
type <span class="code">Random</span> can also be used to generate so-called
Gaussian distributed random real numbers.</p>


<p>The main point here, again, is that many problems have already been solved,
and the solutions are available in Java's standard classes. If you are faced
with a task that looks like it should be fairly common, it might be worth
looking through a Java reference to see whether someone has already written a
class that you can use.</p>
   

   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.3.2">5.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapper Classes and Autoboxing</a>
</h3>


<p>We have already encountered the classes <span class="classname">Double</span> and
<span class="classname">Integer</span> in <a href="../c2/s5.html#basics.5.7">Subection&nbsp;2.5.7</a>.  These classes
contain the <span class="code">static</span> methods <span class="code">Double.parseDouble</span>
and <span class="code">Integer.parseInteger</span> that are used to convert strings to
numerical values.  We have also encountered the <span class="classname">Character</span>
class in some examples, and static methods such as <span class="code">Character.isLetter</span>,
which can be used to test whether a given value of type <span class="code">char</span> is a
letter.  There is a similar class for each of the other primitive types,
<span class="classname">Long</span>, <span class="classname">Short</span>, <span class="classname">Byte</span>, 
<span class="classname">Float</span>, and <span class="classname">Boolean</span>.
These classes are called <span class="newword">wrapper classes</span>.  Although they
contain useful <span class="code">static</span> members, they have another use as
well:  They are used for creating objects that represent primitive type
values.</p>
   

<p>Remember that the primitive types are not classes, and values of primitive type
are not objects.  However, sometimes it's useful to treat a primitive value
as if it were an object.  You can't do that literally, but you can "wrap" the
primitive type value in an object belonging to one of the wrapper classes.</p>
   

<p>For example, an object of type <span class="classname">Double</span> contains a single instance
variable, of type <span class="ptype">double</span>.  The object is a wrapper for the <span class="ptype">double</span> value.
For example, you can create an object that
wraps the <span class="ptype">double</span> value <span class="code">6.0221415e23</span> with</p>
   

<pre>Double d = new Double(6.0221415e23);</pre>
   

<p>The value of <span class="code">d</span> contains the same information as the value of type
<span class="ptype">double</span>, but it is an object.   If you want to retrieve the <span class="ptype">double</span>
value that is wrapped in the object, you can call the function <span class="code">d.doubleValue()</span>.
Similarly, you can wrap an <span class="ptype">int</span>
in an object of type <span class="classname">Integer</span>, a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value
in an object of type <span class="classname">Boolean</span>, and so on.  (As an example of where
this would be useful, the collection classes that will be studied in <a href="futurelink">Chapter 10</a>
can only hold objects.  If you want to add a primitive type value to a collection,
it has to be put into a wrapper object first.)</p>
   

<p>In Java 5.0, wrapper classes have  become easier to use.  Java 5.0 introduced automatic
conversion between a primitive type and the corresponding wrapper class.  For example,
if you use a value of type <span class="ptype">int</span> in a context that requires an object
of type <span class="classname">Integer</span>, the <span class="ptype">int</span> will automatically be
wrapped in an <span class="classname">Integer</span> object.  For example, you can say</p>
   

<pre>Integer answer = 42;</pre>
   

<p>and the computer will silently read this as if it were</p>
   

<pre>Integer answer = new Integer(42);</pre>
   

<p>This is called <span class="newword">autoboxing</span>.   It works in the other direction, too. For example, if
<span class="code">d</span> refers to an object of type <span class="code">Double</span>, you can use <span class="code">d</span>
in a numerical expression such as <span class="code">2*d</span>.  The <span class="ptype">double</span> value inside
<span class="code">d</span> is automatically <span class="newword">unboxed</span> and multiplied by&nbsp;2.  Autoboxing
and unboxing also apply to subroutine calls.  For example, you can pass an actual parameter of type
<span class="ptype">int</span> to a subroutine that has a formal parameter of type <span class="classname">Integer</span>.
In fact, autoboxing and unboxing make it possible in many circumstances to ignore the difference
between primitive types and objects.</p>
     

<hr class="break">
   

<p>The wrapper classes contain a few other things that deserve to be mentioned.  <span class="classname">Integer</span>,
for example, contains constants <span class="code">Integer.MIN_VALUE</span> and <span class="code">Integer.MAX_VALUE</span>,
which are equal to the largest and smallest possible values of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, that
is, to -2147483648 and 2147483647 respectively. It's certainly easier to remember the
names than the numerical values.  There are similar named constants in <span class="classname">Long</span>,
<span class="classname">Short</span>, and <span class="classname">Byte</span>.  <span class="classname">Double</span>
and <span class="classname">Float</span> also have constants named <span class="code">MIN_VALUE</span> and
<span class="code">MAX_VALUE</span>.  <span class="code">MAX_VALUE</span> still gives the largest number that can
be represented in the given type, but <span class="code">MIN_VALUE</span> represents the smallest possible
<b>positive</b> value.  For type <span class="ptype">double</span>, 
<span class="code">Double.MIN_VALUE</span> is 4.9 times 10<sup>-324</sup>.  Since <span class="ptype">double</span> values
have only a finite accuracy, they can't get arbitrarily close to zero.  This is the closest
they can get without actually being equal to zero.</p>
   

<p>The class <span class="classname">Double</span> deserves special mention, since <span class="ptype">double</span>s are so
much more complicated than integers.  The encoding of real numbers into values of type <span class="ptype">double</span>
has room for a few special values that are not real numbers at all in the mathematical sense.
These values are given by named constants in class <span class="classname">Double</span>:
<span class="code">Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</span>, <span class="code">Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY</span>, and
<span class="code">Double.NaN</span>.  The infinite values can occur as the values of certain mathematical
expressions.  For example, dividing a positive number by zero will give the result
<span class="code">Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</span>.  (It's even more complicated than this, actually,
because the <span class="ptype">double</span> type includes a value called "negative zero", written
<span class="code">-0.0</span>.  Dividing a positive number by negative zero gives <span class="code">Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY</span>.)
You also get <span class="code">Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</span> whenever the mathematical value of an
expression is greater than <span class="code">Double.MAX_VALUE</span>.  For example, <span class="code">1e200*1e200</span> is
considered to be infinite. The value <span class="code">Double.NaN</span> is even more interesting.  "NaN" stands for
<span class="newword">Not a Number</span>, and it represents an undefined value such as the square root
of a negative number or the result of dividing zero by zero.  Because of the existence of
<span class="code">Double.NaN</span>, no mathematical operation on real numbers will ever throw an exception;
it simply gives <span class="code">Double.NaN</span> as the result.</p>
   

<p>You can test whether a value, <span class="code">x</span>, of type <span class="ptype">double</span> is infinite or undefined
by calling the  boolean-valued static functions <span class="code">Double.isInfinite(x)</span> and
<span class="code">Double.isNaN()</span>.  (It's especially important to use <span class="code">Double.isNaN()</span> to
test for undefined values, because <span class="code">Double.NaN</span> has really weird behavior when used
with relational operators such as&nbsp;<span class="code">==</span>.  In fact, the values of
<span class="code">x&nbsp;==&nbsp;Double.NaN</span> and <span class="code">x&nbsp;!=&nbsp;Double.NaN</span> are 
<b>both false</b>, no matter what the value of&nbsp;<span class="code">x</span>, so you really can't use
these expressions to test whether <span class="code">x</span> is <span class="code">Double.NaN</span>.)</p>

<a name="OOP.3.3">5.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;The class "Object"</a>
</h3>


<p>We have already seen that one of the major features of object-oriented programming
is the ability to create subclasses of a class.   The subclass inherits all the properties
or behaviors of the class, but can modify and add to what it inherits.  In <a href="../c5/s5.html">Section&nbsp;5.5</a>,
you'll learn how to create subclasses.   What you don't
know yet is that <b>every</b> class in Java (with just one exception) is a subclass
of some other class.  If you create a class and don't explicitly make it a subclass of
some other class, then it automatically becomes a subclass of the special class
named <span class="classname">Object</span>.  (<span class="classname">Object</span> is the one class
that is not a subclass of any other class.)</p>


<p>Class <span class="classname">Object</span> defines several instance methods that are inherited by
every other class.  These methods can be used with any object whatsoever. I will mention
just one of them here.  You will encounter more of them later in the book.</p>
   

<p>The instance method <span class="code">toString()</span> in class <span class="classname">Object</span> returns
a value of type <span class="classname">String</span> that is supposed to be a string representation
of the object.  You've already used this method implicitly,  any time you've printed out an object or
concatenated an object onto a string.  When you use an object in a context that requires a
string, the object is automatically converted to type <span class="classname">String</span> 
by calling its <span class="code">toString()</span> method.</p>


<p>The version of <span class="code">toString</span> that is defined in <span class="classname">Object</span> just returns
the name of the class that the object belongs to, concatenated with a code number called the
<span class="newword">hash code</span> of the object; this is not very useful. When you create a class,
you can write a new <span class="code">toString()</span> method for it, which will replace the inherited
version.  For example, we might add the following method to any of the <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span>
classes from the previous section:</p>


<pre>public String toString() {
       // Return a String representation of a pair of dice, where die1
       // and die2 are instance variables containing the numbers that are
       // showing on the two dice.
   if (die1 == die2)
      return "double " + die1;
   else
      return die1 + " and " + die2;
}</pre>
   

<p>If <span class="code">dice</span> refers to a <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> object, then
<span class="code">dice.toString()</span> will return strings such as "3&nbsp;and&nbsp;6",
"5&nbsp;and&nbsp;1", and "double&nbsp;2", depending on the numbers showing on the dice.
This method would be used automatically to convert <span class="code">dice</span> to type
<span class="classname">String</span> in a statement such as</p>
   

<pre>System.out.println( "The dice came up " + dice );</pre>
   

<p>so this statement might output, "The dice came up 5 and&nbsp;1" or "The
dice came up double 2".  You'll see another example of a <span class="code">toString()</span>
method in the <a href="../c5/s4.html">next section</a>.</p>
   



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.3.4">5.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Object-oriented Analysis and Design</a>
</h3>


<p>Every programmer builds up a stock of techniques and expertise expressed as
snippets of code that can be reused in new programs using the tried-and-true
method of cut-and-paste: The old code is physically copied into the new program
and then edited to customize it as necessary. The problem is that the editing
is error-prone and time-consuming, and the whole enterprise is dependent on the
programmer's ability to pull out that particular piece of code from last year's
project that looks like it might be made to fit. (On the level of a corporation
that wants to save money by not reinventing the wheel for each new project,
just keeping track of all the old wheels becomes a major task.)</p>


<p>Well-designed classes are software components that can be reused without
editing. A well-designed class is not carefully crafted to do a particular job
in a particular program. Instead, it is crafted to model some particular type
of object or a single coherent concept. Since objects and concepts can recur in
many problems, a well-designed class is likely to be reusable without
modification in a variety of projects.</p>


<p>Furthermore, in an object-oriented programming language, it is possible to
make <span class="newword">subclasses</span> of an existing class. This makes
classes even more reusable. If a class needs to be customized, a subclass can
be created, and additions or modifications can be made in the subclass without
making any changes to the original class. This can be done even if the
programmer doesn't have access to the source code of the class and doesn't know
any details of its internal, hidden implementation.</p>


<hr class="break">
   

<p>The <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class in the <a href="../c5/s2.html">previous section</a>
is already an example of a generalized software component, although one that
could certainly be improved. The class represents a single, coherent concept,
"a pair of dice." The instance variables hold the data relevant to the state of
the dice, that is, the number showing on each of the dice. The instance method
represents the behavior of a pair of dice, that is, the ability to be rolled.
This class would be reusable in many different programming projects.</p>


<p>On the other hand, the <span class="classname">Student</span> class from the previous section is
not very reusable. It seems to be crafted to represent students in a particular
course where the grade will be based on three tests. If there are more tests or
quizzes or papers, it's useless. If there are two people in the class who have
the same name, we are in trouble (one reason why numerical student ID's are
often used). Admittedly, it's much more difficult to develop a general-purpose
student class than a general-purpose pair-of-dice class. But this particular
<span class="classname">Student</span> class is good mostly as an example in a programming
textbook.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>A large programming project goes through a number of stages, starting with
<span class="newword">specification</span> of the problem to be solved,
followed by <span class="newword">analysis</span> of the problem and
<span class="newword">design</span> of a program to solve it. Then comes
<span class="newword">coding</span>, in which the program's design is expressed
in some actual programming language. This is followed by <span class="newword">testing</span> 
and <span class="newword">debugging</span> of the
program. After that comes a long period of <span class="newword">maintenance</span>, 
which means fixing any new problems that are
found in the program and modifying it to adapt it to changing requirements.
Together, these stages form what is called the <span class="newword">software life cycle</span>. 
(In the real world, the ideal of consecutive stages is
seldom if ever achieved. During the analysis stage, it might turn out that the
specifications are incomplete or inconsistent. A problem found during testing
requires at least a brief return to the coding stage. If the problem is serious
enough, it might even require a new design. Maintenance usually involves
redoing some of the work from previous stages....)</p>


<p>Large, complex programming projects are only likely to succeed if a careful,
systematic approach is adopted during all stages of the software life cycle.
The systematic approach to programming, using accepted principles of good
design, is called <span class="newword">software engineering</span>. The
software engineer tries to efficiently construct programs that verifiably meet
their specifications and that are easy to modify if necessary. There is a wide
range of "methodologies" that can be applied to help in the systematic design
of programs. (Most of these methodologies seem to involve drawing little boxes
to represent program components, with labeled arrows to represent relationships
among the boxes.)</p>


<p>We have been discussing object orientation in programming languages, which
is relevant to the coding stage of program development. But there are also
object-oriented methodologies for analysis and design. The question in this
stage of the software life cycle is, How can one discover or invent the overall
structure of a program? As an example of a rather simple object-oriented
approach to analysis and design, consider this advice: Write down a description
of the problem. Underline all the nouns in that description. The nouns should
be considered as candidates for becoming classes or objects in the program
design. Similarly, underline all the verbs. These are candidates for methods.
This is your starting point. Further analysis might uncover the need for more
classes and methods, and it might reveal that subclassing can be used to take
advantage of similarities among classes.</p>


<p>This is perhaps a bit simple-minded, but the idea is clear and the general
approach can be effective: Analyze the problem to discover the concepts that
are involved, and create classes to represent those concepts. The design should
arise from the problem itself, and you should end up with a program whose
structure reflects the structure of the problem in a natural way.</p>
