<span class="start"><big>A</big> class represents a set of objects</span> which share the
same structure and behaviors. The class determines the structure of objects by
specifying variables that are contained in each instance of the class, and it
determines behavior by providing the instance methods that express the behavior
of the objects. This is a powerful idea. However, something like this can be
done in most programming languages. The central new idea in object-oriented
programming -- the idea that really distinguishes it from traditional
programming -- is to allow classes to express the similarities among objects
that share <b>some</b>, but not all, of their structure and behavior.
Such similarities can be expressed using <span class="newword">inheritance</span> 
and <span class="newword">polymorphism</span>.</p>

<a name="OOP.5.1">5.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Extending Existing Classes</a>
</h3>

<p>The topics covered later in this section are relatively advanced aspects of
object-oriented programming. Any programmer should know what is meant by
subclass, inheritance, and polymorphism. However, it will probably be a while
before you actually do anything with inheritance except for extending classes
that already exist.  In the first part of this section, we look at how that
is done.</p>


<p>In day-to-day programming, especially for programmers who are just beginning
to work with objects, subclassing is used mainly in one situation: There is an
existing class that can be adapted with a few changes or additions. This is
much more common than designing groups of classes and subclasses from scratch.
The existing class can be <span class="newword">extended</span> to make a
subclass. The syntax for this is</p>


<pre>public class <span class="bnf">subclass-name</span> extends <span class="bnf">existing-class-name</span> {
   .
   .   // Changes and additions.
   .
}</pre>



<p>As an example, suppose you want to write a program that plays the card game,
Blackjack. You can use the <span class="classname">Card</span>, 
<span class="classname">Hand</span>, and <span class="classname">Deck</span>
classes developed in <a href="../c5/s4.html">Section&nbsp;5.4</a>. However, a hand in the
game of Blackjack is a little different from a hand of cards in general, since
it must be possible to compute the "value" of a Blackjack hand according to the
rules of the game. The rules are as follows: The value of a hand is obtained by
adding up the values of the cards in the hand. The value of a numeric card such
as a three or a ten is its numerical value. The value of a Jack, Queen, or King
is 10. The value of an Ace can be either 1 or 11. An Ace should be counted as
11 unless doing so would put the total value of the hand over 21. Note that
this means that the second, third, or fourth Ace in the hand will always be
counted as 1.</p>


<p>One way to handle this is to extend the existing <span class="classname">Hand</span> class by
adding a method that computes the Blackjack value of the hand. Here's the
definition of such a class:</p>


<pre>public class BlackjackHand extends Hand {

    /**
     * Computes and returns the value of this hand in the game
     * of Blackjack.
     */
    public int getBlackjackValue() {

        int val;      // The value computed for the hand.
        boolean ace;  // This will be set to true if the
                      //   hand contains an ace.
        int cards;    // Number of cards in the hand.

        val = 0;
        ace = false;
        cards = getCardCount();

        for ( int i = 0;  i &lt; cards;  i++ ) {
                // Add the value of the i-th card in the hand.
            Card card;    // The i-th card; 
            int cardVal;  // The blackjack value of the i-th card.
            card = getCard(i);
            cardVal = card.getValue();  // The normal value, 1 to 13.
            if (cardVal &gt; 10) {
                cardVal = 10;   // For a Jack, Queen, or King.
            }
            if (cardVal == 1) {
                ace = true;     // There is at least one ace.
            }
            val = val + cardVal;
         }

         // Now, val is the value of the hand, counting any ace as 1.
         // If there is an ace, and if changing its value from 1 to 
         // 11 would leave the score less than or equal to 21,
         // then do so by adding the extra 10 points to val. 

         if ( ace == true  &amp;&amp;  val + 10 &lt;= 21 )
             val = val + 10;

         return val;

    }  // end getBlackjackValue()

} // end class BlackjackHand</pre>


<p>Since <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span> is a subclass of <span class="classname">Hand</span>, an object of
type <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span> contains all the instance variables and instance
methods defined in <span class="classname">Hand</span>, plus the new instance method named
<span class="code">getBlackjackValue()</span>. For example, if <span class="code">bjh</span> is a variable of
type <span class="code">BlackjackHand</span>, then the following are all legal:
<span class="code">bjh.getCardCount()</span>, <span class="code">bjh.removeCard(0)</span>, and
<span class="code">bjh.getBlackjackValue()</span>.  The first two methods are defined in <span class="classname">Hand</span>,
but are inherited by <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span>.</p>


<p>Inherited variables and methods from the <span class="classname">Hand</span> class can also be
used in the definition of <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span> (except for any that are
declared to be <span class="code">private</span>, which prevents access even by subclasses). The statement "<span class="code">cards =
getCardCount();</span>" in the above definition of <span class="code">getBlackjackValue()</span>
calls the instance method <span class="code">getCardCount()</span>, which was defined in
<span class="classname">Hand</span>.</p>


<p>Extending existing classes is an easy way to build on previous work. We'll
see that many standard classes have been written specifically to be used as the
basis for making subclasses.</p>
   

<hr class="break">
   

<p>Access modifiers such as <span class="code">public</span> and <span class="code">private</span> are used
to control access to members of a class.  There is one more access modifier,
<span class="newword">protected</span>, that comes into the picture when subclasses are taken
into consideration.  When <span class="code">protected</span> is applied as an access modifier
to a method or member variable in a class,
that member can be used in subclasses -- direcct or indirect -- of the class in which
it is defined, but it cannot be used in non-subclasses.  (There is one exception: A <span class="code">protected</span> member
can also be accessed by any class in the same package as the class that contains the protected member.
Recall that using no access modifier makes a member accessible to classes in the same package, and nowhere
else.  Using the <span class="code">protected</span> modifier is strictly more liberal than using no modifier
at all:  It allows access from classes in the same package and from <b>subclasses</b> that are not
in the same package.)</p>
   

<p>When you declare a method or member variable to be <span class="code">protected</span>, you are saying
that it is part of the implementation of the class, rather than part of the public interface of
the class.  However, you are allowing subclasses to use and modify that part of the implementation.</p>
   

<p>For example, consider a <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class that has instance
variables <span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span>
to represent the numbers appearing on the two dice.  We could make those variables
<span class="code">private</span> to make it impossible to change their values from outside the
class, while still allowing read access through getter methods.  However, if we think
it possible that <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> will be used to create subclasses,
we might want to make it possible for subclasses to change the numbers on the dice.
For example, a <span class="classname">GraphicalDice</span> subclass that draws the dice might
want to change the numbers at other times besides when the dice are rolled.
In that case, we could make <span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span>
<span class="code">protected</span>, which would allow the
subclass to change their values without making them public to the rest of the world.
(An even better idea would be to define <span class="code">protected</span> setter methods for
the variables.  A setter method could, for example, ensure that the value that is
being assigned to the variable is in the legal range 1 through&nbsp;6.)</p>

<img src="subclass.png" width="119" height="175" align="right" alt="">
   
<p>The term <span class="newword">inheritance</span> refers to the fact that
one class can inherit part or all of its structure and behavior from another
class. 
The class that does the inheriting is said to be a <span class="newword">subclass</span> 
of the class from which it inherits. If class B is a
subclass of class A, we also say that class A is a <span class="newword">superclass</span> of 
class B. (Sometimes the terms <span class="newword">derived class</span> and <span class="newword">base class</span> are
used instead of subclass and superclass; this is the common terminology in&nbsp;C++.) 
A subclass can add to the structure
and behavior that it inherits. It can also replace or modify inherited behavior
(though not inherited structure). The relationship between subclass and
superclass is sometimes shown by a diagram in which the subclass is shown
below, and connected to, its superclass.</p>





<p>In Java, to create a class named "B" as a subclass of a class named "A", 
you would write</p>


<pre>class B extends A {
    .
    .  // additions to, and modifications of,
    .  // stuff inherited from class A
    .
}</pre>
   

<img src="hierarchy.png" width="257" height="184" align="left" alt=""> 

<p>Several classes
can be declared as subclasses of the same superclass. The subclasses, which
might be referred to as "sibling classes," share some structures and behaviors -- namely, 
the ones they inherit from their common superclass. The superclass
expresses these shared structures and behaviors. In the diagram to the left,
classes B, C, and D are sibling classes. Inheritance can also extend over
several "generations" of classes. This is shown in the diagram, where class E
is a subclass of class D which is itself a subclass of class A. In this case,
class E is considered to be a subclass of class A, even though it is not a
direct subclass.  This whole set of classes forms a small
<span class="newword">class hierarchy</span>.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.5.3">5.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: Vehicles</a>
</h3>


<p>Let's look at
an example. Suppose that a program has to deal with motor vehicles, including
cars, trucks, and motorcycles. (This might be a program used by a Department of
Motor Vehicles to keep track of registrations.) The program could use a class
named <span class="classname">Vehicle</span> to represent all types of vehicles.  Since cars, trucks,
and motorcycles are types of vehicles, they would be represented by subclasses
of the <span class="classname">Vehicle</span> class, as shown in this class hierarchy diagram:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="vehicles.png" width="290" height="123" alt=""></p> 
   

<p>The <span class="classname">Vehicle</span>
class would include instance variables such as <span class="code">registrationNumber</span> and
<span class="code">owner</span> and instance methods such as <span class="code">transferOwnership()</span>. These
are variables and methods common to all vehicles. The three subclasses of
<span class="classname">Vehicle</span> -- <span class="classname">Car</span>, 
<span class="classname">Truck</span>, and <span class="classname">Motorcycle</span> -- could
then be used to hold variables and methods specific to particular types
of vehicles. The <span class="classname">Car</span> class might add an instance variable
<span class="code">numberOfDoors</span>, the <span class="classname">Truck</span> class might have
<span class="code">numberOfAxels</span>, and the <span class="classname">Motorcycle</span> class could have a boolean
variable <span class="code">hasSidecar</span>. (Well, it <u>could</u> in theory at least, even
if it might give a chuckle to the people at the Department of Motor Vehicles.)
The declarations of these classes in Java program would look, in outline, like
this (although in practice, they would probably be <span class="code">public</span> classes, defined
in separate files):</p>


<pre>class Vehicle {
   int registrationNumber;
   Person owner;  // (Assuming that a Person class has been defined!)
   void transferOwnership(Person newOwner) {
       . . .
   }
   . . .
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
   int numberOfDoors;
   . . .
}

class Truck extends Vehicle {
   int numberOfAxels;
   . . .
}

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
   boolean hasSidecar;
   . . .
}</pre>


<p>Suppose that <span class="code">myCar</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Car</span> that has been
declared and initialized with the statement</p>


<pre>Car myCar = new Car();</pre>


<p>Given this declaration, a program could refer to
<span class="code">myCar.numberOfDoors</span>, since <span class="code">numberOfDoors</span> is an instance
variable in the class <span class="code">Car</span>. But since class <span class="classname">Car</span> extends class
<span class="classname">Vehicle</span>, a car also has all the structure and behavior of a vehicle.
This means that <span class="code">myCar.registrationNumber</span>, <span class="code">myCar.owner</span>, and
<span class="code">myCar.transferOwnership()</span> also exist.</p>


<p>Now, in the real world, cars, trucks, and motorcycles are in fact vehicles.
The same is true in a program. That is, an object of type <span class="classname">Car</span> or
<span class="classname">Truck</span> or <span class="classname">Motorcycle</span> is automatically an object of type
<span class="classname">Vehicle</span> too. This brings us to the following Important Fact:</p>


<div align="center">
<p>
<b>A variable that can hold a reference<br>
to an object of class A can also hold a reference<br>
to an object belonging to any subclass of A.</b>
</p>

</div>


<p>The practical effect of this in our example is that an object of type
<span class="classname">Car</span> can be assigned to a variable of type <span class="classname">Vehicle</span>. That is,
it would be legal to say</p>


<pre>Vehicle myVehicle = myCar;</pre>


<p>or even</p>


<pre>Vehicle myVehicle = new Car();</pre>


<p>After either of these statements, the variable <span class="code">myVehicle</span> holds a
reference to a <span class="classname">Vehicle</span> object that happens to be an instance of the
subclass, <span class="classname">Car</span>. The object "remembers" that it is in fact a
<span class="classname">Car</span>, and not <b>just</b> a <span class="classname">Vehicle</span>. Information about the
actual class of an object is stored as part of that object. It is even possible
to test whether a given object belongs to a given class, using the
<span class="code">instanceof</span> operator. The test:</p>


<pre>if (myVehicle instanceof Car) ...</pre>


<p>determines whether the object referred to by <span class="code">myVehicle</span> is in fact a
car.</p>


<p>On the other hand, the assignment statement</p>


<pre>myCar = myVehicle;</pre>


<p>would be illegal because <span class="code">myVehicle</span> could potentially refer to other
types of vehicles that are not cars. This is similar to a problem we saw
previously in <a href="../c2/s5.html#basics.5.6">Subection&nbsp;2.5.6</a>: The computer will not
allow you to assign an <span class="ptype">int</span> value to a variable of type <span class="ptype">short</span>,
because not every <span class="ptype">int</span> is a <span class="ptype">short</span>. Similarly, it will not
allow you to assign a value of type <span class="classname">Vehicle</span> to a variable of type
<span class="classname">Car</span> because not every vehicle is a car. As in the case of
<span class="ptype">int</span>s and <span class="ptype">short</span>s, the solution here is to use type-casting.
If, for some reason, you happen to know that <span class="code">myVehicle</span> does in fact
refer to a <span class="classname">Car</span>, you can use the type cast <span class="code">(Car)myVehicle</span> to
tell the computer to treat <span class="code">myVehicle</span> as if it were actually of type
<span class="classname">Car</span>. So, you could say</p>


<pre>myCar = (Car)myVehicle;</pre>


<p>and you could even refer to <span class="code">((Car)myVehicle).numberOfDoors</span>. As an
example of how this could be used in a program, suppose that you want to print
out relevant data about a vehicle. You could say:</p>


<pre>System.out.println("Vehicle Data:");
System.out.println("Registration number:  " 
                              + myVehicle.registrationNumber);
if (myVehicle instanceof Car) {
   System.out.println("Type of vehicle:  Car");
   Car c;
   c = (Car)myVehicle;
   System.out.println("Number of doors:  " + c.numberOfDoors);
}
else if (myVehicle instanceof Truck) {
   System.out.println("Type of vehicle:  Truck");
   Truck t;
   t = (Truck)myVehicle;
   System.out.println("Number of axels:  " + t.numberOfAxels);
}
else if (myVehicle instanceof Motorcycle) {
   System.out.println("Type of vehicle:  Motorcycle");
   Motorcycle m;
   m = (Motorcycle)myVehicle;
   System.out.println("Has a sidecar:    " + m.hasSidecar);
}</pre>


<p>Note that for object types, when the computer executes a program, it checks
whether type-casts are valid. So, for example, if <span class="code">myVehicle</span> refers to
an object of type <span class="code">Truck</span>, then the type cast <span class="code">(Car)myVehicle</span>
would be an error.  When this happes, an exception of type
<span class="classname">ClassCastException</span> is thrown.</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.5.4">5.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Polymorphism</a>
</h3>



<p>As another example, consider a program that deals with shapes drawn on the
screen. Let's say that the shapes include rectangles, ovals, and roundrects of
various colors.  (A "roundrect" is just a rectangle with rounded corners.)</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="shapes.png" width="396" height="159" alt="(illustration showing various shapes)" class="bordered"></p>


<p>Three classes, <span class="classname">Rectangle</span>, <span class="classname">Oval</span>, and <span class="classname">RoundRect</span>,
could be used to represent the three types of shapes. These three classes would
have a common superclass, <span class="classname">Shape</span>, to represent features that all three
shapes have in common. The <span class="classname">Shape</span> class could include instance
variables to represent the color, position, and size of a shape, and it could
include instance methods for changing the color, position, and size.
Changing the color, for example, might involve changing the value of an
instance variable, and then redrawing the shape in its new color:</p>


<pre>class Shape {

    Color color;   // Color of the shape.  (Recall that class Color
                   // is defined in package java.awt.  Assume
                   // that this class has been imported.)
                   
    void setColor(Color newColor) {
          // Method to change the color of the shape.
       color = newColor; // change value of instance variable
       redraw(); // redraw shape, which will appear in new color
    }
    
    void redraw() {
          // method for drawing the shape
       ? ? ?  // what commands should go here?
    }

    . . .          // more instance variables and methods
 
} // end of class Shape</pre>


<p>Now, you might see a problem here with the method <span class="code">redraw()</span>. The
problem is that each different type of shape is drawn differently. The method
<span class="code">setColor()</span> can be called for any type of shape. How does the computer
know which shape to draw when it executes the <span class="code">redraw()</span>? Informally, we
can answer the question like this: The computer executes <span class="code">redraw()</span> by
asking the shape to redraw <b>itself</b>. Every shape object knows
what it has to do to redraw itself.</p>


<p>In practice, this means that each of the specific shape classes has its own
<span class="code">redraw()</span> method:</p>


<pre>class Rectangle extends Shape {
   void redraw() {
      . . .  // commands for drawing a rectangle
   }
   . . . // possibly, more methods and variables
}
class Oval extends Shape {
   void redraw() {
      . . .  // commands for drawing an oval
   }
   . . . // possibly, more methods and variables
}
class RoundRect extends Shape {
   void redraw() {
      . . .  // commands for drawing a rounded rectangle
   }
   . . . // possibly, more methods and variables
}</pre>


<p>If <span class="code">oneShape</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Shape</span>, it could refer to
an object of any of the types, <span class="classname">Rectangle</span>, <span class="classname">Oval</span>, or
<span class="classname">RoundRect</span>. As a program executes, and the value of <span class="code">oneShape</span>
changes, it could even refer to objects of different types at different times!
Whenever the statement</p>


<pre>oneShape.redraw();</pre>


<p>is executed, the redraw method that is actually called is the one
appropriate for the type of object to which <span class="code">oneShape</span> actually refers.
There may be no way of telling, from looking at the text of the program, what
shape this statement will draw, since it depends on the value that
<span class="code">oneShape</span> happens to have when the program is executed. Even more is
true. Suppose the statement is in a loop and gets executed many times. If the
value of <span class="code">oneShape</span> changes as the loop is executed, it is possible that
the very same statement "<span class="code">oneShape.redraw();</span>" will call different
methods and draw different shapes as it is executed over and over. We say that
the <span class="code">redraw()</span> method is <span class="newword">polymorphic</span>. A
method is polymorphic if the action performed by the method depends on the
actual type of the object to which the method is applied. Polymorphism is one
of the major distinguishing features of object-oriented programming.</p>


<p>Perhaps this becomes more understandable if we change our terminology a bit:
In object-oriented programming, calling a method is often referred to as
sending a <span class="newword">message</span> to an object. The object
responds to the message by executing the appropriate method. The statement
"<span class="code">oneShape.redraw();</span>" is a message to the object referred to by
<span class="code">oneShape</span>. Since that object knows what type of object it is, it knows
how it should respond to the message. From this point of view, the computer
always executes "<span class="code">oneShape.redraw();</span>" in the same way: by sending a
message. The response to the message depends, naturally, on who receives it.
From this point of view, objects are active entities that send and receive
messages, and polymorphism is a natural, even necessary, part of this view.
Polymorphism just means that different objects can respond to the same message
in different ways.</p>


<p> One of the
most beautiful things about polymorphism is that it lets code that you write do
things that you didn't even conceive of, at the time you wrote it. Suppose that
I decide to add beveled rectangles to the types of shapes my program can deal
with.  A beveled rectangle has a triangle cut off each corner:</p>
   

<p align="center">
<img src="BeveledRects.png" width="140" height="163" alt="" class="bordered"></p>

   

<p>To implement beveled rectangles, I can write a new subclass, <span class="classname">BeveledRect</span>, of
class <span class="classname">Shape</span> and give it its own <span class="code">redraw()</span> method.
Automatically, code that I wrote previously -- such as the statement
<span class="code">oneShape.redraw()</span> -- can now suddenly start drawing beveled
rectangles, even though the beveled rectangle class didn't exist when I wrote
the statement!</p>


<p>In the statement "<span class="code">oneShape.redraw();</span>", the <span class="code">redraw</span> message
is sent to the object <span class="code">oneShape</span>. Look back at the method from the
<span class="classname">Shape</span> class for changing the color of a shape:</p>


<pre>void setColor(Color newColor) {
   color = newColor; // change value of instance variable
   redraw(); // redraw shape, which will appear in new color
}</pre>


<p>A <span class="code">redraw</span> message is sent here, but which object is it sent to?
Well, the <span class="code">setColor</span> method is itself a message that was sent to some
object. The answer is that the <span class="code">redraw</span> message is sent to that same
object, the one that received the <span class="code">setColor</span> message. If that object is
a rectangle, then it is the <span class="code">redraw()</span> method from the
<span class="classname">Rectangle</span> class that is executed. If the object is an oval, then it is
the <span class="code">redraw()</span> method from the <span class="classname">Oval</span> class. This is what you
should expect, but it means that the <span class="code">redraw();</span> statement in the
<span class="code">setColor()</span> method does <b>not</b> necessarily call the
<span class="code">redraw()</span> method in the <span class="classname">Shape</span> class! The <span class="code">redraw()</span>
method that is executed could be in any subclass of <span class="classname">Shape</span>.</p>


<p>Again, this is not a real surprise if you think about it in the right way.
Remember that an instance method is always contained in an object. The class
only contains the source code for the method. When a <span class="classname">Rectangle</span> object
is created, it contains a <span class="code">redraw()</span> method. The source code for that
method is in the <span class="classname">Rectangle</span> class. The object also contains a
<span class="code">setColor()</span> method. Since the <span class="classname">Rectangle</span> class does not define
a <span class="code">setColor()</span> method, the <b>source code</b> for the rectangle's
<span class="code">setColor()</span> method comes from the superclass, <span class="classname">Shape</span>, but
the <b>method itself</b> is in the object of type <span class="classname">Rectangle</span>.  Even
though the source codes for the two methods are in different classes, the
methods themselves are part of the same object. When the rectangle's
<span class="code">setColor()</span> method is executed and calls <span class="code">redraw()</span>, the
<span class="code">redraw()</span> method that is executed is the one in the same object.</p>

<a name="OOP.5.5">5.5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract Classes</a>
</h3>


<p>Whenever a <span class="classname">Rectangle</span>, <span class="classname">Oval</span>, or <span class="classname">RoundRect</span> object
has to draw itself, it is the <span class="code">redraw()</span> method in the appropriate class
that is executed. This leaves open the question, What does the
<span class="code">redraw()</span> method in the <span class="classname">Shape</span> class do? How should it be
defined?</p>


<p>The answer may be surprising: We should leave it blank! The fact is that the
class <span class="classname">Shape</span> represents the abstract idea of a shape, and there is no
way to draw such a thing. Only particular, concrete shapes like rectangles and
ovals can be drawn. So, why should there even be a <span class="code">redraw()</span> method in
the <span class="classname">Shape</span> class? Well, it has to be there, or it would be illegal to
call it in the <span class="code">setColor()</span> method of the <span class="classname">Shape</span> class, and it
would be illegal to write "<span class="code">oneShape.redraw()</span>;", where
<span class="code">oneShape</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Shape</span>. The compiler would
complain that <span class="code">oneShape</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Shape</span> and
there's no <span class="code">redraw()</span> method in the <span class="classname">Shape</span> class.</p>


<p>Nevertheless the version of <span class="code">redraw()</span> in the <span class="classname">Shape</span> class itself
will never actually be called. In fact, if you think about it, there can never be any
reason to construct an actual object of type <span class="classname">Shape</span>! You can have
<b>variables</b> of type <span class="classname">Shape</span>, but the objects they refer
to will always belong to one of the subclasses of <span class="classname">Shape</span>. We say that
<span class="classname">Shape</span> is an <span class="newword">abstract class</span>. An abstract
class is one that is not used to construct objects, but only as a basis for
making subclasses. An abstract class exists <b>only</b> to express
the common properties of all its subclasses.  A class that is not abstract
is said to be <span class="newword">concrete</span>.  You can create objects belonging to
a concrete class, but not to an abstract class.  A variable whose type is given
by an abstract class can only refer to objects that belong to concrete subclasses
of the abstract class.</p>


<p>Similarly, we say that the <span class="code">redraw()</span> method in class <span class="classname">Shape</span>
is an <span class="newword">abstract method</span>, since it is never meant to
be called. In fact, there is nothing for it to do -- any actual redrawing is
done by <span class="code">redraw()</span> methods in the subclasses of <span class="classname">Shape</span>. The
<span class="code">redraw()</span> method in <span class="classname">Shape</span> has to be there. But it is there
only to tell the computer that all <span class="code">Shapes</span> understand the
<span class="code">redraw</span> message. As an abstract method, it exists merely to specify the
common interface of all the actual, concrete versions of <span class="code">redraw()</span> in
the subclasses of <span class="classname">Shape</span>. There is no reason for the abstract
<span class="code">redraw()</span> in class <span class="classname">Shape</span> to contain any code at all.</p>


<p>
<span class="classname">Shape</span> and its <span class="code">redraw()</span> method are semantically abstract.
You can also tell the computer, syntactically, that they are abstract by adding
the modifier "<span class="code">abstract</span>" to their definitions. For an abstract method,
the block of code that gives the implementation of an ordinary method is
replaced by a semicolon. An implementation must be provided for the abstract
method in any concrete subclass of the abstract class. Here's what the
<span class="classname">Shape</span> class would look like as an abstract class:</p>


<pre>public abstract class Shape {

    Color color;   // color of shape. 
                              
    void setColor(Color newColor) {
          // method to change the color of the shape
       color = newColor; // change value of instance variable
       redraw(); // redraw shape, which will appear in new color
    }
    
    abstract void redraw();
          // abstract method -- must be defined in 
          // concrete subclasses

    . . .          // more instance variables and methods

} // end of class Shape</pre>


<p>Once you have declared the class to be <span class="code">abstract</span>, it becomes illegal to try to create actual objects
of type <span class="classname">Shape</span>, and the computer will report a syntax error if you try to do
so.</p>


<hr class="break">   


<p>Recall from <a href="../c5/s3.html#OOP.3.3">Subection&nbsp;5.3.3</a> that a class that is not explicitly declared to be a subclass
of some other class is automatically made a subclass of the standard class <span class="classname">Object</span>.
That is, a class declaration with no "<span class="code">extends</span>" part such as</p>


<pre>public class myClass { . . .</pre>


<p>is exactly equivalent to</p>


<pre>public class myClass extends Object { . . .</pre>


<p>This means that class <span class="classname">Object</span> is at the top of a huge class hierarchy that
includes every other class.  (Semantially, <span class="classname">Object</span> is an abstract class, in fact
the most abstract class of all.  Curiously, however, it is not declared to be <span class="code">abstract</span>
syntactially, which means that you can create objects of type <span class="classname">Object</span>.  What
you would do with them, however, I have no idea.)</p>


<p>Since every class is a subclass of <span class="classname">Object</span>, a variable of type
<span class="classname">Object</span> can refer to any object whatsoever, of any type.  Java
has several standard data structures that are designed to hold <span class="classname">Object</span>s,
but since every object is an instance of class <span class="classname">Object</span>, these
data structures can actually hold any object whatsoever.  One example is the
"ArrayList" data structure, which is defined by the class <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>
in the package <span class="code">java.util</span>.  (<span class="classname">ArrayList</span> is discussed more fully in
<a href="../c7/s3.html">Section&nbsp;7.3</a>.)  An <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> is simply a list of <span class="classname">Object</span>s.
This class is very convenient, because an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> can hold any number of objects, and
it will grow, when necessary, as objects are added to it. Since the items in
the list are of type <span class="code">Object</span>, the list can actually hold objects of any
type.</p>


<p>A program that wants to keep track of various <span class="classname">Shape</span>s that have been
drawn on the screen can store those shapes in an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>. Suppose
that the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> is named <span class="code">listOfShapes</span>. A shape,
<span class="code">oneShape</span>, can be added to the end of the list by calling the instance
method "<span class="code">listOfShapes.add(oneShape);</span>". The shape can be removed from
the list with the instance method "<span class="code">listOfShapes.remove(oneShape);</span>". The number of shapes
in the list is given by the function "<span class="code">listOfShapes.size()</span>". And it is
possible to retrieve the i-th object from the list with the function call
"<span class="code">listOfShapes.get(i)</span>". (Items in the list are numbered from 0 to
<span class="code">listOfShapes.size()&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span>.) However, note that this method returns an
<span class="classname">Object</span>, not a <span class="classname">Shape</span>. (Of course, the people who wrote the
<span class="code">ArrayList</span> class didn't even know about <span class="classname">Shapes</span>, so the method
they wrote could hardly have a return type of <span class="classname">Shape</span>!) Since you know
that the items in the list are, in fact, <span class="classname">Shape</span>s and not just
<span class="classname">Object</span>s, you can type-cast the <span class="classname">Object</span> returned by
<span class="code">listOfShapes.get(i)</span> to be a value of type <span class="classname">Shape</span>:</p>


<pre>oneShape = (Shape)listOfShapes.get(i);</pre>


<p>Let's say, for example, that you want to redraw all the shapes in the list.
You could do this with a simple <span class="code">for</span> loop, which is lovely example of
object-oriented programming and of polymorphism:</p>


<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; listOfShapes.size(); i++) {
   Shape s;  // i-th element of the list, considered as a Shape
   s = (Shape)listOfShapes.get(i);
   s.redraw();  // What is drawn here depends on what type of shape s is!
}</pre>
   

<hr class="break">


<p>The sample source code file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/ShapeDraw.java">ShapeDraw.java</a></span> uses an abstract
<span class="classname">Shape</span> class and an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> to hold a list of shapes.
The file defines an applet in which the user can add various shapes to a drawing area.
Once a shape is in the drawing area, the user can use the mouse to drag it around.</p>
   

<p>You might want to look at this file, even though you won't be able to
understand all of it at this time. Even the definitions of the shape classes
are somewhat different from those that I have described in this section. (For example,
the <span class="code">draw()</span> method has a parameter of type
<span class="classname">Graphics</span>. This parameter is required because of the way Java handles
all drawing.) I'll return to this example in later chapters when you know more
about GUI programming. However, it would still be worthwhile to look at the definition
of the <span class="classname">Shape</span> class and its subclasses in the source code.
You might also check how an <span class="code">ArrayList</span> is used to hold the list of shapes.
</p>
   
   

   

<p>Here is the applet that is defined by <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/ShapeDraw.java">ShapeDraw.java</a></span>:</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="ShapeDraw.class" width="500" height="275" archive="ShapeDrawApplet.jar" alt="(Applet 'ShapeDraw' should be displayed here.)"></applet></p>


<p>If you click one of the buttons along the bottom of this applet, a shape
will be added to the screen in the upper left corner of the applet. The color
of the shape is given by the "pop-up menu" in the lower right. Once a shape is
on the screen, you can drag it around with the mouse. A shape will maintain the
same front-to-back order with respect to other shapes on the screen, even while
you are dragging it. However, you can move a shape out in front of all the
other shapes if you hold down the shift key as you click on it.</p>
   



<p>In the applet the only time when the actual class of a shape is used is
when that shape is added to the screen. Once the shape has been created, it is
manipulated entirely as an abstract shape. The routine that implements
dragging, for example, works only with variables of type <span class="classname">Shape</span>. As the
<span class="classname">Shape</span> is being dragged, the dragging routine just calls the
<span class="code">Shape's</span> draw method each time the shape has to be drawn, so it doesn't
have to know how to draw the shape or even what type of shape it is. The object
is responsible for drawing itself. If I wanted to add a new type of shape to
the program, I would define a new subclass of <span class="classname">Shape</span>, add another
button to the applet, and program the button to add the correct type of shape
to the screen. No other changes in the programming would be necessary.</p>
