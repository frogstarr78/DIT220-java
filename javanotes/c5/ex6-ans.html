<h2>Solution for Programmming Exercise 5.6</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.6:</h3>
<p>
<a href="../c5/s7.html#OOP.7.6">Subection&nbsp;5.7.6</a> discusses the possibility of representing
the suits and values of playing cards as enumerated types.  Rewrite the <span class="classname">Card</span>
class from <a href="../c5/s4.html#OOP.4.2">Subection&nbsp;5.4.2</a> to use these enumerated types.  Test your class with a program
that prints out the 52 possible playing cards.  Suggestions:  You can modify the source code file
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Card.java">Card.java</a></span>, but you should leave out support for Jokers.
In your main program, use nested <span class="code">for</span> loops to
generated cards of all possible suits and values; the <span class="code">for</span> loops will be
"for-each" loops of the type discussed in <a href="../c3/s4.html#control.4.4">Subection&nbsp;3.4.4</a>.  It would be
nice to add a <span class="code">toString()</span> method to the <span class="classname">Suit</span> class
from <a href="../c5/s7.html#OOP.7.6">Subection&nbsp;5.7.6</a>, so that a suit prints out as "Spades" or "Hearts" instead
of "SPADES" or "HEARTS".

<p>
<span class="classname">CardValue</span> is defined in <a href="../c5/s7.html#OOP.7.6">Subection&nbsp;5.7.6</a>,
and is repeated below just as given there.  I've added a <span class="code">toString()</span>
method to the definition of <span class="classname">Suit</span> from the same section.
Given the two enumerated types, we can now represent the suit and the value
of a playing card using values of type <span class="classname">Suit</span> and <span class="classname">CardValue</span>,
instead of coding the suit and value as integers.
In the <span class="classname">Card</span> class, the <span class="ptype">int</span> variables
<span class="code">suit</span> and <span class="code">value</span> should be replaced with variables of
type <span class="classname">Suit</span> and <span class="classname">CardValue</span>.  The
named constants such as HEARTS and ACE in the <span class="classname">Card</span> class,
which were used to represent suits and card values, should be deleted; they
have been replaced by the constants from the enumerated types.
The original <span class="classname">Card</span> class included instance methods
<span class="code">getSuitAsString()</span> and <span class="code">getValueAsString()</span> to convert the
suit and value of a card into an appropriate string representation.  These methods
are no longer necessary, since each enumerated types has its own <span class="code">toString()</span>
method that will automatically be used to do the conversion to string.</p>

<p>Class <span class="classname">Card</span> becomes much shorter in this version.
(Most of the missing code has been moved into the enumerated types.) We just
need the two instance variables to represent the suit and value of a card,
getter methods to return the values of these two methods, a <span class="code">toString()</span>
method to do the <span class="classname">Card</span>-to-<span class="classname">String</span>
conversion, and a constructor that specifies the suit and value of the card
that is being constructed:</p>

<pre>public class Card {
   Suit suit;        // The suit of this card.
   CardValue value;  // The value of this card.
   public Card( Suit theSuit, CardValue theValue ) {   // Constructor.
      suit = theSuit;
      value = theValue;
   }
   public Suit getSuit() {
      return suit;
   }
   public CardValue getValue() {
      return value;
   }
   public String toString() {
      return value + " of " + suit;  // A string such as "Ace of Spades"
   }
}</pre>

<p>I've made just one addition (besides comments) in the version given below.
Since enumerated type values are objects, the value of a variable of type
<span class="classname">Suit</span> or <span class="classname">CardValue</span> can be <span class="code">null</span>.
However, it doesn't make sense for the suit or value of a <span class="classname">Card</span>
to be <span class="code">null</span>.  As the class stands, there is nothing to stop someone
from passing <span class="code">null</span> as the value of one of the actual parameters in the
constructor, and that would result in an invalid <span class="classname">Card</span> object.
To prevent this, I check the parameters in the constructor and throw a
<span class="classname">NullPointerException</span> if an actual parameter is <span class="code">null</span>.</p>

<p>The main program simply constructs each of the 52 possible cards, and prints out
each card.  The algorithm uses "for-each" loops to loop through all the possible
suits and all the possible card values:</p>

<pre>for each Suit:
   for each CardValue:
      Let c be a new Card with given suit and value
      print c
</pre>

<p>Using the <span class="code">for</span> loop syntax from <a href="../c3/s4.html#control.4.4">Subection&nbsp;3.4.4</a>, 
a loop such as "<span class="code">for each Suit</span>" becomes "<span class="code">for (Suit suit : Suit.values())</span>",
and this leads to the <span class="code">main()</span> routine shown below.</p>
