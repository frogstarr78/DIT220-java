<p>
<span class="start"><big>W</big>hen a number of data items</span> are chunked together
into a unit, the result is a <span class="newword">data structure</span>. Data
structures can be very complex, but in many applications, the
appropriate data structure consists simply of a sequence of data items. Data
structures of this simple variety can be either <span class="newword">arrays</span> or 
<span class="newword">records</span>.</p>


<p>The term "record" is not used in Java. A record is essentially the same as a
Java object that has instance variables only, but no instance methods. Some
other languages, which do not support objects in general, nevertheless do
support records. The C programming language, for example, is not
object-oriented, but it has records, which in C go by the name "struct." The
data items in a record -- in Java, an object's instance variables -- are called
the <span class="newword">fields</span> of the record. Each item is referred to
using a <span class="newword">field name</span>. In Java, field names are just
the names of the instance variables. The distinguishing characteristics of a
record are that the data items in the record are referred to by name and that
different fields in a record are allowed to be of different types. For example,
if the class <span class="classname">Person</span> is defined as:</p>


<pre>class Person {
   String name;
   int id_number;
   Date birthday;
   int age;
}</pre>


<p>then an object of class <span class="classname">Person</span> could be considered to be a record
with four fields. The field names are <span class="code">name</span>, <span class="code">id_number</span>,
<span class="code">birthday</span>, and <span class="code">age</span>. Note that the fields are of various types:
<span class="classname">String</span>, <span class="ptype">int</span>, and <span class="classname">Date</span>.</p>


<p>Because records are just a special type of object, I will not discuss them
further.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.1.1">7.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrays</a>
</h3>   


<p>Like a record, an array is a sequence of items. However, where items in a
record are referred to by <b>name</b>, the items in an array are
numbered, and individual items are referred to by their <b>position
number</b>. Furthermore, all the items in an array must be of the same
type. The definition of an array is: a numbered sequence of items, which are
all of the same type. The number of items in an array is called the
<span class="newword">length</span> of the array. The position number of an
item in an array is called the <span class="newword">index</span> of that item.
The type of the individual items in an array is called the 
<span class="newword">base type</span> of the array.</p>


<p>The base type of an array can be any Java type, that is, one of the
primitive types, or a class name, or an interface name. If the base type of an
array is <span class="ptype">int</span>, it is referred to as an "array of <span class="ptype">ints</span>." An
array with base type <span class="classname">String</span> is referred to as an "array of
<span class="classname">Strings</span>." However, an array is not, properly speaking, a list of
integers or strings or other <b>values</b>. It is better thought of
as a list of <b>variables</b> of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, or of type
<span class="classname">String</span>, or of some other type. As always, there is some potential for
confusion between the two uses of a variable: as a name for a memory location
and as a name for the value stored in that memory location. Each position in an
array acts as a variable. Each position can hold a value of a specified type
(the base type of the array). The value can be changed at any time. Values are
stored <b>in</b> an array. The array <b>is</b> the
container, not the values.</p>


<p>The items in an array -- really, the individual variables that make up the
array -- are more often referred to as the <span class="newword">elements</span> 
of the array. In Java, the elements in an array are
always numbered starting from zero. That is, the index of the first element in
the array is zero. If the length of the array is <span class="code">N</span>, then the index of
the last element in the array is <span class="code">N-1</span>. Once an array has been created,
its length cannot be changed.</p>


<p>Java arrays are <b>objects</b>. This has several consequences.
Arrays are created using a form of the <span class="code">new</span> operator. No variable can
ever <b>hold</b> an array; a variable can only <b>refer</b>
to an array. Any variable that can refer to an array can also hold the value
<span class="code">null</span>, meaning that it doesn't at the moment refer to anything. Like
any object, an array belongs to a class, which like all classes is a subclass
of the class <span class="classname">Object</span>. The elements of the array are, essentially,
instance variables in the array object, except that they are referred to by
number rather than by name.</p>


<p>Nevertheless, even though arrays are objects, there are differences between
arrays and other kinds of objects, and there are a number of special language
features in Java for creating and using arrays.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.1.2">7.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Arrays</a>
</h3>


<p>Suppose that <span class="code">A</span> is a variable that refers to an array. Then the element
at index <span class="code">k</span> in <span class="code">A</span> is referred to as <span class="code">A[k]</span>. The first
element is <span class="code">A[0]</span>, the second is <span class="code">A[1]</span>, and so forth.
"<span class="code">A[k]</span>" is really a variable, and it can be used just like any other
variable. You can assign values to it, you can use it in expressions, and you
can pass it as a parameter to a subroutine. All of this will be discussed in
more detail below. For now, just keep in mind the syntax</p>


<pre>
<span class="bnf">array-variable</span> [ <span class="bnf">integer-expression</span> ]</pre>


<p>for referring to an element of an array.</p>


<p>Although every array, as an object, belongs to some class, array classes
never have to be defined. Once a type exists, the corresponding array class
exists automatically. If the name of the type is <span class="classname">BaseType</span>, then the
name of the associated array class is <span class="atype">BaseType[]</span>. That is to say, an
object belonging to the class <span class="atype">BaseType[]</span> is an array of items, where
each item is a variable of type <span class="classname">BaseType</span>. The brackets, "<span class="code">[]</span>",
are meant to recall the syntax for referring to the individual items in the
array. "<span class="atype">BaseType[]</span>" is read as "array of BaseType" or "BaseType
array." It might be worth mentioning here that if <span class="classname">ClassA</span> is a subclass
of <span class="classname">ClassB</span>, then the class <span class="atype">ClassA[]</span> is automatically a subclass of
<span class="atype">ClassB[]</span>.</p>


<p>The base type of an array can be any legal Java type. From the primitive
type <span class="ptype">int</span>, the array type <span class="atype">int[]</span> is derived. Each element in an
array of type <span class="atype">int[]</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, which holds a
value of type <span class="ptype">int</span>. From a class named <span class="classname">Shape</span>, the array type
<span class="atype">Shape[]</span> is derived. Each item in an array of type <span class="atype">Shape[]</span> is
a variable of type <span class="classname">Shape</span>, which holds a value of type <span class="classname">Shape</span>.
This value can be either <span class="code">null</span> or a reference to an object belonging to
the class <span class="classname">Shape</span>. (This includes objects belonging to subclasses of
<span class="classname">Shape</span>.)</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Let's try to get a little more concrete about all this, using arrays of
integers as our first example. Since <span class="atype">int[]</span> is a class, it can be used
to declare variables. For example,</p>


<pre>int[] list;</pre>


<p>creates a variable named <span class="code">list</span> of type <span class="atype">int[]</span>. This variable
is <b>capable</b> of referring to an array of <span class="code">ints</span>, but initially its
value is <span class="code">null</span> (if <span class="code">list</span> is a member variable in a class) or undefined (if
<span class="code">list</span> is a local variable in a method). The <span class="code">new</span> operator is used to
create a new array object, which can then be assigned to <span class="code">list</span>. The
syntax for using <span class="code">new</span> with arrays is different from the syntax you
learned previously. As an example,</p>


<pre>list = new int[5];</pre>


<p>creates an array of five integers. More generally, the constructor "<span class="code">new
BaseType[N]</span>" is used to create an array belonging to the class
<span class="atype">BaseType[]</span>. The value <span class="code">N</span> in brackets specifies the length of
the array, that is, the number of elements that it contains. Note that the
array "knows" how long it is. The length of the array is an instance variable
in the array object. In fact, the length of an array, <span class="code">list</span>, can be
referred to as <span class="code">list.length</span>. (However, you are not allowed to change
the value of <span class="code">list.length</span>, so it's really a "<span class="code">final</span>" instance
variable, that is, one whose value cannot be changed after it has been
initialized.)</p>


<p>The situation produced by the statement "<span class="code">list = new int[5];</span>" can be
pictured like this:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="array_of_ints.png" width="506" height="183" alt="(Illustration of an array of ints)"></p>



<p>Note that the newly created array of integers is automatically filled with
zeros. In Java, a newly created array is <b>always</b> filled with a known,
default value: zero for numbers, <span class="code">false</span> for <span class="ptype">boolean</span>, the
character with Unicode number zero for <span class="ptype">char</span>, and <span class="code">null</span> for
objects.</p>


<p>The elements in the array, <span class="code">list</span>, are referred to as
<span class="code">list[0]</span>, <span class="code">list[1]</span>, <span class="code">list[2]</span>, <span class="code">list[3]</span>, and
<span class="code">list[4]</span>. (Note again that the index for the last item is one less than
<span class="code">list.length</span>.) However, array references can be much more general than
this. The brackets in an array reference can contain any expression whose value
is an integer. For example if <span class="code">indx</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span>,
then <span class="code">list[indx]</span> and <span class="code">list[2*indx+7]</span> are syntactically correct
references to elements of the array <span class="code">list</span>. Thus, the following loop
would print all the integers in the array, <span class="code">list</span>, to standard
output:</p>


<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++) {
   System.out.println( list[i] );
}</pre>


<p>The first time through the loop, <span class="code">i</span> is 0, and <span class="code">list[i]</span>
refers to <span class="code">list[0]</span>. So, it is the value stored in the variable
<span class="code">list[0]</span> that is printed. The second time through the loop, <span class="code">i</span>
is 1, and the value stored in <span class="code">list[1]</span> is printed. The loop ends after
printing the value of <span class="code">list[4]</span>, when <span class="code">i</span> becomes equal to 5 and
the continuation condition "<span class="code">i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;list.length</span>" is no longer true. This
is a typical example of using a loop to process an array. I'll discuss more
examples of array processing throughout this chapter.</p>


<p>Every use of a variable in a program specifies a memory location. Think for
a moment about what the computer does when it encounters a reference to an
array element, <span class="code">list[k]</span>, while it is executing a program. The computer
must determine which memory location is being referred to. To the computer,
<span class="code">list[k]</span> means something like this: "Get the pointer that is stored in
the variable, <span class="code">list</span>. Follow this pointer to find an array object. Get
the value of <span class="code">k</span>. Go to the <span class="code">k</span>-th position in the array, and
that's the memory location you want." There are two things that can go wrong
here. Suppose that the value of <span class="code">list</span> is <span class="code">null</span>. If that is the case,
then <span class="code">list</span> doesn't even refer to an array. The attempt to refer to an
element of an array that doesn't exist is an error that will cause an exception of
type <span class="classname">NullPointerException</span> to be thrown.. 
 The second possible error occurs if <span class="code">list</span> does
refer to an array, but the value of <span class="code">k</span> is outside the legal range of
indices for that array. This will happen if <span class="code">k&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0</span> or if <span class="code">k&nbsp;&gt;=
list.length</span>. This is called an "array index out of bounds" error. 
When an error of this type occurs, an exception of type
<span class="classname">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span> is thrown.
When you use arrays in a program, you should be mindful that both types of errors are
possible. However, array index out of bounds errors are by far the most common
error when working with arrays.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.1.3">7.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Array Initialization</a>
</h3>
   


<p>For an array variable, just as for any variable, you can declare the
variable and initialize it in a single step. For example,</p>


<pre>int[] list = new int[5];</pre>


<p>If <span class="code">list</span> is a local variable in a subroutine, then this is exactly
equivalent to the two statements:</p>


<pre>int[] list;
list = new int[5];</pre>


<p>(If <span class="code">list</span> is an instance variable, then of course you can't simply
replace "<span class="code">int[] list = new int[5];</span>" with "<span class="code">int[] list; list = new
int[5];</span>" since the assignment statement "<span class="code">list = new int[5];</span>" is
only legal inside a subroutine.)</p>


<p>The new array is filled with the default value appropriate for the base type
of the array -- zero for <span class="ptype">int</span> and <span class="code">null</span> for class types, for
example. However, Java also provides a way to initialize an array variable with
a new array filled with a specified list of values. In a declaration statement
that creates a new array, this is done with an <span class="newword">array initializer</span>. 
For example,</p>


<pre>int[] list = { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 };</pre>


<p>creates a new array containing the seven values 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49,
and sets <span class="code">list</span> to refer to that new array. The value of
<span class="code">list[0]</span> will be 1, the value of <span class="code">list[1]</span> will be 4, and so
forth. The length of <span class="code">list</span> is seven, since seven values are provided in
the initializer.</p>


<p>An array initializer takes the form of a list of values, separated by commas
and enclosed between braces. The length of the array does not have to be
specified, because it is implicit in the list of values. The items in an array
initializer don't have to be constants. They can be variables or arbitrary
expressions, provided that their values are of the appropriate type. For
example, the following declaration creates an array of eight <span class="classname">Colors</span>.
Some of the colors are given by expressions of the form "<span class="code">new Color(r,g,b)</span>
instead of by constants":</p>


<pre>Color[] palette = {
             Color.black,
             Color.red,
             Color.pink,
             new Color(0,180,0),  // dark green
             Color.green,
             Color.blue,
             new Color(180,180,255),  // light blue
             Color.white
           };</pre>


<p>A list initializer of this form can be used <b>only</b> in a declaration
statement, to give an initial value to a newly declared array variable. It
cannot be used in an assignment statement to assign a value to a variable that
has been previously declared. However, there is another, similar notation for
creating a new array that can be used in an assignment statement or passed as a
parameter to a subroutine. The notation uses another form of the <span class="code">new</span>
operator to both create and initialize a new array object at the same time.
(The rather odd syntax
is similar to the syntax for anonymous classes, which were discussed in
<a href="../c5/s7.html#OOP.7.3">Subection&nbsp;5.7.3</a>.) For example to assign a new value to
an array variable, <span class="code">list</span>, that was declared previously, you could
use:</p>


<pre>list = new int[] { 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343 };</pre>


<p>The general syntax for this form of the <span class="code">new</span> operator is</p>


<pre>new <span class="bnf">base-type</span> [ ] { <span class="bnf">list-of-values</span> }</pre>


<p>This is actually an expression whose value is a reference to a newly created
array object. This means that it can be used in any
context where an object of type <span class="bnf">base-type</span><span class="code">[]</span> is expected. For example, if
<span class="code">makeButtons</span> is a method that takes an array of <span class="classname">Strings</span> as a
parameter, you could say:</p>


<pre>makeButtons( new String[] { "Stop", "Go", "Next", "Previous" } );</pre>
   

<p>Being able to create and use an array "in place" in this way can be very convenient,
in the same way that anonymous nested classes are convenient.</p>
   

<p>By the way, it is perfectly legal to use the "<span class="code">new BaseType[] {&nbsp;...&nbsp;}</span>" syntax
instead of the array initializer syntax in the declaration of an array variable.  For example,
instead of saying:</p>
   

<pre>int[] primes = { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 };</pre>
   

<p>you can say, equivalently,</p>
   

<pre>int[] primes = new int[] { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19 };</pre>
   

<p>In fact, rather than use a special notation that works only in the context
of declaration statements, I prefer to use the second form.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>One final note: For historical reasons, an array declaration such as</p>


<pre>int[] list;</pre>


<p>can also be written as</p>
   

<pre>int list[];</pre>


<p>which is a syntax used in the languages C and C++. However, this alternative
syntax does not really make much sense in the context of Java, and it is
probably best avoided. After all, the intent is to declare a variable of a
certain type, and the name of that type is "<span class="atype">int[]</span>". It makes sense to
follow the "<span class="bnf">type-name</span>  <span class="bnf">variable-name</span>;" syntax for such declarations.</p>
