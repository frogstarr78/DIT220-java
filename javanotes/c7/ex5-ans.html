<h2>Solution for Programmming Exercise 7.5</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.5:</h3>
<p>The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomArtPanel.java">RandomArtPanel.java</a></span> from
<a href="../c6/s5.html#GUI1.5.1">Subection&nbsp;6.5.1</a> shows a different random "artwork" every four seconds.  There
are three types of "art", one made from lines, one from circles, and one from filled
squares.  However, the program does not save the data for the picture that is shown
on the screen.  As a result, the picture cannot be redrawn when necessary.  In fact, 
every time <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> is called, a new picture is drawn.</p>

<p>Write a new version of <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomArtPanel.java">RandomArtPanel.java</a></span> that saves the
data needed to redraw its pictures.   The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method
should simply use the data to draw the picture.  New data should be recomputed
only every four seconds, in response to an event from the timer that drives the
program.</p>

<p>To make this interesting, write a separate class for each of the three different
types of art.  Also write an abstract class to serve as the common base class for
the three classes.  Since all three types of art use a random gray background, 
the background color can be defined in their superclass.  The superclass also
contains a <span class="code">draw()</span> method that draws the picture; this is an abstract
method because its implementation depends on the particular type of art that
is being drawn.  The abstract class can be defined as:</p>

<pre>
private abstract class ArtData {
   Color backgroundColor;  // The background color for the art.
   ArtData() {  // Constructor sets background color to be a random gray.
      int x = (int)(256*Math.random());
      backgroundColor = new Color( x, x, x, );
   }
   abstract void draw(Graphics g);  // Draws this artwork.
}</pre>

<p>Each of the three subclasses of <span class="code">ArtData</span> must define its own <span class="code">draw()</span>
method.  It must also define instance variables to hold the data necessary to draw the
picture.  I suggest that you should create random data for the picture in the constructor
of the class, so that  constructing the object will automatically create the data for a random
artwork. (One problem with this is that you can't create the data until you know the
size of the panel, so you can't create an artdata object in the constructor of the panel.
One solution is to create an artdata object at the beginning of the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
method, if the object has not already been created.)
In all three subclasses, you will need to use several arrays 
to store the data.</p>

<p>The file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomArtPanel.java">RandomArtPanel.java</a></span> only defines a panel class.  A
main program that uses this panel can be found in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomArt.java">RandomArt.java</a></span>,
and an applet that uses it can be found in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomArtApplet.java">RandomArtApplet.java</a></span>.</p>

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>In my solution, I defined subclasses <span class="classname">LineArtData</span>,
<span class="classname">CircleArtData</span>, and <span class="classname">SquareArtData</span> of
the basic abstract <span class="classname">ArtData</span> class.  An instance variable named
<span class="code">artData</span>, of type <span class="classname">ArtData</span>, points to the object that
holds the data for the current picture.  When it's time to create a new artwork,
I call the following method, which changes the value of <span class="code">artData</span>.  Note
that this method has an equal chance of producing each of the three types of art:</p>

<pre>/**
 * Creates an object belonging to one of the three subclasses of
 * ArtData, and assigns that object to the instance variable, artData.
 * The subclass to use (that is, the type of art) is chosen at random.
 */
private void createArtData() {
   switch ( (int)(3*Math.random()) ) {
   case 0:
      artData = new LineArtData();
      break;
   case 1:
      artData = new CircleArtData();
      break;
   case 2:
      artData = new SquareArtData();
      break;
   }
}</pre>

<p>This method is called by the action listener that responds to events from the timer,
so a new artwork is created every time the timer generates and event, that is, every four seconds.</p>

<p>The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method uses the background color from <span class="code">artData</span>
to fill the drawing area.  It then tells <span class="code">artData</span> to draw itself by calling
its <span class="code">draw()</span> method.  As suggested in the exercise, it first makes sure
that an art data object has been created by calling <span class="code">createArtData()</span> if
<span class="code">artData</span> is still null; this can only be true the first time <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
is called.  So, the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method is quite simple:</p>


<pre>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {

   if (artData == null)  // If no artdata has yet been created, create it.
      createArtData();
   
   // Note:  Since the next two lines fill the entire panel, there is
   // no need to call super.paintComponent(g), since any drawing
   // that it does will only be covered up anyway.
   
   g.setColor(artData.backgroundColor); // Fill with the art's background color.
   g.fillRect( 0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight() );

   artData.draw(g);  // Draw the art.
     
} // end paintComponent()</pre>

<p>The only thing that remains for discussion is the three classes that define the three
types of art.  Note that we have been able to get this far without thinking about creating
or drawing the actual art.  This is because we have been thinking "abstractly," in terms of the
abstract class.</p>

<p>Let's look in detail at <span class="classname">LineArtData</span>, one of the three concrete 
subclasses of <span class="classname">ArtData</span>.  In the original program, line art was
drawn in the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method as follows:</p>

<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 500; i++) {
   int x1 = (int)(getWidth() * Math.random());
   int y1 = (int)(getHeight() * Math.random());
   int x2 = (int)(getWidth() * Math.random());
   int y2 = (int)(getHeight() * Math.random());
   Color randomHue = Color.getHSBColor( (float)Math.random(), 1.0F, 1.0F);
   g.setColor(randomHue);
   g.drawLine(x1,y1,x2,y2);
}</pre>

<p>Here, the coordinates and colors for each line are chosen at random and the line is immediately
drawn using that data.  For the new version, we want to save the data in instance variables
so that the picture can be drawn and redrawn on demand.  The creation of the data will be split
from the drawing; the data will be created in the constructor and will be used to draw the
picture in the <span class="code">draw()</span> method.   To save the data for all 500 lines,
we have to store the coordinates and colors in arrays.  There are several ways to do this,
but I used one array for each piece of data, <span class="code">x1</span>, <span class="code">y1</span>, <span class="code">x2</span>,
<span class="code">y2</span>, and the color.  To store data for 500 lines, each array should be of length
500.  For example, <span class="code">x1</span> is declared as an instance variable of type
<span class="atype">int[]</span>, and the array is created with the command "<span class="code">x1 = new&nbsp;int[500];</span>".
The arrays are created in the <span class="classname">LineArtData</span> constructor and are filled with random data.
In the <span class="code">draw()</span> method, the <span class="code">i-th</span> line can be drawn with the commands:</p>

<pre>g.setColor( color[i] );    // Use the i-th color in the array
g.drawLine( x1[i], y1[i], x2[i], y2[i] );</pre>

<p>We just need a <span class="code">for</span> loop to draw all the lines.  The complete definition of
<span class="classname">LineArtData</span> class is as follows:</p>

<pre>/**
 * Stores data for a picture that contains 500 random lines drawn in
 * different random colors.
 */
private class LineArtData extends ArtData {
   Color[] color;         // color[i] is the color of line number i
   int[] x1, y1, x2, y2;  // line i goes from (x1[i],y1[i]) to (x2[i],y2[i]).
   LineArtData() {  // Constructor creates arrays and fills then randomly.
      color = new Color[500];
      x1 = new int[500];
      y1 = new int[500];
      x2 = new int[500];
      y2 = new int[500];
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 500; i++) {
         x1[i] = (int)(getWidth() * Math.random());
         y1[i] = (int)(getHeight() * Math.random());
         x2[i] = (int)(getWidth() * Math.random());
         y2[i] = (int)(getHeight() * Math.random());
         color[i] = Color.getHSBColor( (float)Math.random(), 1.0F, 1.0F);
      }
   }
   void draw(Graphics g) {  // Draw the picture.
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 500; i++) {
         g.setColor(color[i]);
         g.drawLine( x1[i], y1[i], x2[i], y2[i] );
      }
   }
}</pre>

<p>The other two classes are very similar.  Note that we are using the technique of 
"parallel arrays" here.  That is, the data for the <span class="code">i-th</span> line is spread out
over five different arrays.  An array of objects, where each object holds all the data
for one line, might be better style but it seemed to be to be overkill for this
simple example.</p>
