           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.4:</h3>
<p>For this problem, you will
need to use an array of objects. The objects belong to the class
<span class="classname">MovingBall</span>, which I have already written. You can find the source code
for this class in the file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/MovingBall.java">MovingBall.java</a></span>. A <span class="classname">MovingBall</span>
represents a circle that has an associated color, radius, direction, and speed.
It is restricted to moving in a rectangle in the <span class="code">(x,y)</span> plane. It will
"bounce back" when it hits one of the sides of this rectangle. A
<span class="classname">MovingBall</span> does not actually move by itself. It's just a collection of
data. You have to call instance methods to tell it to update its position and
to draw itself. The constructor for the <span class="classname">MovingBall</span> class takes the
form</p>


<pre>new MovingBall(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)</pre>


<p>where the parameters are integers that specify the limits on the <span class="code">x</span>
and <span class="code">y</span> coordinates of the ball. In this exercise, you will want balls
to bounce off the sides of the applet, so you will create them with the
constructor call</p>
   

<pre>new MovingBall(0, getWidth(), 0, getHeight())</pre> 


<p>The constructor creates a ball that initially is colored red, has a radius of 5
pixels, is located at the center of its range, has a random speed between 4 and
12, and is headed in a random direction. There is one <b>problem</b> here:  You
can't use this constructor until the width and height of the component are known.
It would be OK to use it in the <span class="code">init()</span> method of an applet, but not
in the constructor of an applet or panel class.  If you are using a panel class to
display the ball, one slightly messy solution is to create the <span class="classname">MovingBall</span> 
objects in the panel's <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method the first time that method
is called.  You can be sure that the size of the panel has been determined before
<span class="code">paintComponent()</span> is called.  This is what I did in my own solution to
this exercise.</p>
   

<p>If <span class="code">ball</span> is a variable of type
<span class="classname">MovingBall</span>, then the following methods are available:</p>
   

<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">ball.draw(g)</span>  --  draw the ball in a
graphics context. The parameter, <span class="code">g</span>, must be of type <span class="code">Graphics</span>.
(The drawing color in <span class="code">g</span> will be changed to the color of the
ball.)</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">ball.travel()</span>  --  change the
<span class="code">(x,y)-</span>coordinates of the ball by an amount equal to its speed. The
ball has a certain direction of motion, and the ball is moved in that
direction. Ordinarily, you will call this once for each frame of an animation,
so the speed is given in terms of "pixels per frame". Calling this routine does
not move the ball on the screen. It just changes the values of some instance
variables in the object. The next time the object's <span class="code">draw()</span> method is
called, the ball will be drawn in the new position.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">ball.headTowards(x,y)</span>  --  change the
direction of motion of the ball so that it is headed towards the point
<span class="code">(x,y)</span>. This does not affect the speed.</li>

</ul>

<p>These are the methods that you will need for this exercise. There are also
methods for setting various properties of the ball, such as 
<span class="code">ball.setColor(color)</span> for changing the color and
<span class="code">ball.setRadius(radius)</span> for changing its
size. See the source code for more information.</p>


<p>For this exercise, you should create an applet that shows an animation of
balls bouncing around on a black background. Use a <span class="classname">Timer</span>
to drive the animation.  (See <a href="../c6/s5.html#GUI1.5.1">Subection&nbsp;6.5.1</a>.)  Use an array of
type <span class="code">MovingBall[]</span> to hold the data for the balls.
In addition, your program should listen for mouse and mouse motion events. 
When the user presses the mouse or
drags the mouse, call each of the ball's <span class="code">headTowards()</span> methods to make
the balls head towards the mouse's location.
My solution uses 50 balls and a time delay of 50 milliseconds for the timer.</p>


<p>Here is my solution. Try clicking and dragging on the applet:</p>

<p align="center">
<applet code="BallisticBalls.class" width="400" height="300" archive="BallisticBalls.jar" alt=""></applet></p>

<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>The solution to this exercise is not very long, although it 
is rather complicated conceptually and it might take time
to get used to working with arrays of objects.</p>
   

<p>My program uses a nested class named <span class="classname">Display</span>, defined
as a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span> as a drawing surface where the moving
balls are drawn.  The main class is a subclass of <span class="classname">JApplet</span>, but
it just uses an object of type <span class="classname">Display</span> as its contenet pane.
Here, I only discuss the programming of the <span class="classname">Display</span> class.</p>
    

<p>An instance variable of type
<span class="atype">MovingBall[]</span> is needed to hold the data for the  balls. This
instance variable can be declared as</p>


<pre>MovingBall[] balls;</pre>


<p>As discussed in the exercise, it is not possible to create the ball objects
in the constructor of the <span class="classname">Display</span> class, so I create the
array and the ball objects that it contains in the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>.
This should only be done once, the first time <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
is called.  To achieve this, I test whether <span class="code">balls == null</span> at the
begining of the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method.  If not, then the
objects have already been created; if so, then this is the first time
<span class="code">paintComponent()</span> is being called, and the objects must be
created.  The array object is created with a statement of the form
"<span class="code">balls = new MovingBall[ballCount];</span>" where <span class="code">ballCount</span>
is the number of balls. However, this just gives an array filled with <span class="code">null</span> values. There
aren't any balls yet. Each of the balls must be created with a call to the
constructor from the <span class="code">MovingBall</span> class:</p>


<pre>if (balls == null) {
   balls = new MovingBall[ ballCount ];  // Create the array
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; balls.length; i++) {
         // Create each of the ball objects.  The parameters specify
         // that the balls are restricted to moving within the bounds
         // of the panel.
      balls[i] = new MovingBall(0, getWidth(), 0, getHeight());
   }
}</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method must draw the balls.  I decided to
put the code for moving the balls into the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method
as well.  This means that each ball will move in its current direction of motion
by a small amount each time <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> is called.  The
<span class="code">i</span>-th ball can be moved by calling its <span class="code">travel()</span> method with
the command "<span class="code">balls[i].travel()</span>". It can be drawn in the graphics
context <span class="code">g</span> by calling its <span class="code">draw()</span> method with the command
<span class="code">balls[i].draw(g);</span>". To apply these commands to every ball in the
array, we need a <span class="code">for</span> loop</p>


<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; balls.length; i++) {
    balls[i].travel();
    balls[i].draw(g);
}</pre>
   

<p>An alternative to this would be the for-each loop:</p>
   

<pre>for ( MovingBall ball : balls ) {
   ball.travel();
   ball.draw(g);  
}</pre>


<p>Similarly, in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> and
<span class="code">mouseDragged()</span> routine, we need a <span class="code">for</span> loop 
(or for-each loop) to tell each ball
to head towards the location of the mouse,
<span class="code">(evt.getX(),evt.getY())</span>:</p>


<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; balls.length; i++) {
   balls[i].headTowards(evt.getX(),evt.getY());
}</pre>
   

<p>My program uses anonymous inner classes for the mouse listener and mouse motion
listener.  We also need a timer to drive the animation.  Since the balls move
every time <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> is called, the response to an action event
from the time is simply to call <span class="code">repaint()</span>, which will in turn cause
<span class="code">paintComponent()</span> to be called.  The action listener for the timer
is also defined by an anonymous inner class:</p>


<pre>Timer timer = new Timer(millisecondsPerFrame, new ActionListener() {
       // This timer will drive the animation by calling repaint()
       // at periodic intervals.
   public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
      repaint();
   }
});
timer.start();</pre>


<p>That's really all there is to it. You might want to try variations like
giving the balls random colors or sizes. This can be done when the ball objects
are created in the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method. 
In my program, I decided to use applet parameters to
make it possible to customize the applet by specifying the number of balls and
by setting the speed at which the animation plays.
Recall that applet parameters are specified in the
<span class="code">&lt;applet&gt;</span> tag on the web page. The following applet tag specifies
and applet fewer balls, moving more slowly, than the default:</p>


<pre>&lt;applet code="BallisticBalls.class" archive="BallisticBalls.jar" width=400 height=300&gt;
   &lt;param name="frameTime" value="25"&gt;
   &lt;param name="ballCount" value="100"&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">param</span> with name "ballCount" specifies the number of balls in
the applet. The <span class="code">param</span> with name "frameTime" specifies the number of
milliseconds to use for each frame of the animation. You can look at the source
code for the applet, below, to see how I use these params. The method
<span class="code">getIntParam()</span> demonstrates how to get an integer value from an applet
param.</p>
