<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>he size of an array</span> is fixed when it is created.
In many cases, however, the number of data items that are actually stored in
the array varies with time. Consider the following examples: An array that
stores the lines of text in a word-processing program. An array that holds the
list of computers that are currently downloading a page from a Web site. An
array that contains the shapes that have been added to the screen by the user
of a drawing program. Clearly, we need some way to deal with cases where the
number of data items in an array is not fixed.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.3.1">7.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Partially Full Arrays</a>
</h3>


<p>Consider an application where the number of items that we want to store in
an array changes as the program runs. Since the size of the array can't
actually be changed, a separate counter variable must be used to keep track of
how many spaces in the array are in use. (Of course, every space in the array
has to contain something; the question is, how many spaces contain useful or
valid items?)</p>


<p>Consider, for example, a program that reads positive integers entered by the
user and stores them for later processing. The program stops reading when the
user inputs a number that is less than or equal to zero. The input numbers can
be kept in an array, <span class="code">numbers</span>, of type <span class="atype">int[]</span>. Let's say that
no more than 100 numbers will be input. Then the size of the array can be fixed
at 100. But the program must keep track of how many numbers have actually been
read and stored in the array. For this, it can use an integer variable,
<span class="code">numCount</span>. Each time a number is stored in the array, <span class="code">numCount</span> must
be incremented by one. As a rather silly example, let's write a program that
will read the numbers input by the user and then print them in reverse order.
(This is, at least, a processing task that requires that the numbers be saved
in an array. Remember that many types of processing, such as finding the sum or
average or maximum of the numbers, can be done without saving the individual
numbers.)</p>


<pre>public class ReverseInputNumbers {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
     int[] numbers;  // An array for storing the input values.
     int numCount;   // The number of numbers saved in the array.
     int num;        // One of the numbers input by the user.
     
     numbers = new int[100];   // Space for 100 ints.
     numCount = 0;             // No numbers have been saved yet.
     
     TextIO.putln("Enter up to 100 positive integers; enter 0 to end.");
     
     while (true) {   // Get the numbers and put them in the array.
        TextIO.put("? ");
        num = TextIO.getlnInt();
        if (num &lt;= 0)
           break;
        numbers[numCount] = num;
        numCount++;
     }
     
     TextIO.putln("\nYour numbers in reverse order are:\n");
     
     for (int i = numCount - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
         TextIO.putln( numbers[i] );
     }
     
   } // end main();
   
}  // end class ReverseInputNumbers</pre>


<p>It is especially important to note that the variable <span class="code">numCount</span> plays a
dual role. It is the number of items that have been entered into the array.
But it is also the index of the next available spot in the array. For example,
if 4 numbers have been stored in the array, they occupy locations number 0, 1,
2, and 3. The next available spot is location 4. When the time comes to print
out the numbers in the array, the last occupied spot in the array is location
<span class="code">numCount - 1</span>, so the <span class="code">for</span> loop prints out values starting from
location <span class="code">numCount - 1</span> and going down to 0.</p>


<p>Let's look at another, more realistic example. Suppose that you write a game
program, and that players can join the game and leave the game as it
progresses. As a good object-oriented programmer, you probably have a class
named <span class="classname">Player</span> to represent the individual players in the game. A list
of all players who are currently in the game could be stored in an array,
<span class="code">playerList</span>, of type <span class="atype">Player[]</span>. Since the number of players can
change, you will also need a variable, <span class="code">playerCt</span>, to record the number
of players currently in the game. Assuming that there will never be more than
10 players in the game, you could declare the variables as:</p>


<pre>Player[] playerList = new Player[10];  // Up to 10 players.
int      playerCt = 0;  // At the start, there are no players.</pre>


<p>After some players have joined the game, <span class="code">playerCt</span> will be greater
than 0, and the player objects representing the players will be stored in the
array elements <span class="code">playerList[0]</span>, <span class="code">playerList[1]</span>, ...,
<span class="code">playerList[playerCt-1]</span>. Note that the array element
<span class="code">playerList[playerCt]</span> is <b>not</b> in use. The procedure for
adding a new player, <span class="code">newPlayer</span>, to the game is simple:</p>


<pre>playerList[playerCt] = newPlayer; // Put new player in next
                                  //     available spot.
playerCt++;  // And increment playerCt to count the new player.</pre>


<p>Deleting a player from the game is a little harder, since you don't want to
leave a "hole" in the array. Suppose you want to delete the player at index
<span class="code">k</span> in <span class="code">playerList</span>. If you are not worried about keeping the
players in any particular order, then one way to do this is to move the player
from the last occupied position in the array into position <span class="code">k</span> and then
to decrement the value of <span class="code">playerCt</span>:</p>


<pre>playerList[k] = playerList[playerCt - 1];
playerCt--;</pre>


<p>The player previously in position <span class="code">k</span> is no longer in the array. The
player previously in position <span class="code">playerCt - 1</span> is now in the array twice.
But it's only in the occupied or valid part of the array once, since
<span class="code">playerCt</span> has decreased by one. Remember that every element of the
array has to hold some value, but only the values in positions 0 through
<span class="code">playerCt&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span> will be looked at or processed in any way.
(By the way, you should think what happens if the player that is being deleted
is in the last position in the list.  The code does still work in this case.  What
exactly happens?)</p>


<p>Suppose that when deleting the player in position <span class="code">k</span>, you'd like to
keep the remaining players in the same order. (Maybe because they take turns in
the order in which they are stored in the array.) To do this, all the players
in positions <span class="code">k+1</span> and above must move down one position in the array.
Player <span class="code">k+1</span> replaces player <span class="code">k</span>, who is out of the game. Player
<span class="code">k+2</span> fills the spot left open when player <span class="code">k+1</span> is moved. And so
on. The code for this is</p>


<pre>for (int i = k+1; i &lt; playerCt; i++) {
    playerList[i-1] = playerList[i];
}
playerCt--;</pre>


<hr class="break">


<p>It's worth emphasizing that the <span class="classname">Player</span> example deals with an array
whose base type is a class. An item in the array is either <span class="code">null</span> or is
a reference to an object belonging to the class, <span class="classname">Player</span>. The
<span class="classname">Player</span> objects themselves are not really stored in the array, only
references to them. Note that because of the rules for assignment in Java, the
objects can actually belong to subclasses of <span class="classname">Player</span>. Thus there could
be different classes of players such as computer players, regular
human players, players who are wizards, ..., all represented by different
subclasses of <span class="classname">Player</span>.</p>


<p>As another example, suppose that a class <span class="classname">Shape</span> represents the
general idea of a shape drawn on a screen, and that it has subclasses to
represent specific types of shapes such as lines, rectangles, rounded
rectangles, ovals, filled-in ovals, and so forth. (<span class="classname">Shape</span> itself would
be an abstract class, as discussed in <a href="../c5/s5.html#OOP.5.5">Subection&nbsp;5.5.5</a>.)
Then an array of type <span class="atype">Shape[]</span> can hold references to objects belonging
to the subclasses of <span class="classname">Shape</span>. For example, the situation created by the
statements</p>


<pre>Shape[] shapes = new Shape[100]; // Array to hold up to 100 shapes.
shapes[0] = new Rect();          // Put some objects in the array.
shapes[1] = new Line(); 
shapes[2] = new FilledOval(); 
int shapeCt = 3;  // Keep track of number of objects in array.</pre>


<p>could be illustrated as:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="array_of_objects.png" width="417" height="208" alt="(Array containing references to three objects)"></p>


<p>Such an array would be useful in a drawing program. The array could be used
to hold a list of shapes to be displayed. If the <span class="code">Shape</span> class includes
a method, "<span class="code">void redraw(Graphics&nbsp;g)</span>" for drawing the shape in a
graphics context <span class="code">g</span>, then all the shapes in the array could be redrawn
with a simple for loop:</p>


<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; shapeCt; i++)
   shapes[i].redraw(g);</pre>


<p>The statement "<span class="code">shapes[i].redraw(g);</span>" calls the <span class="code">redraw()</span>
method belonging to the particular shape at index <span class="code">i</span> in the array. Each
object knows how to redraw itself, so that repeated executions of the statement
can produce a variety of different shapes on the screen. This is nice example
both of polymorphism and of array processing.</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.3.2">7.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynamic Arrays</a>
</h3>


<p>In each of the above examples, an arbitrary limit was set on the number of
items -- 100 <span class="ptype">ints</span>, 10 <span class="classname">Players</span>, 100 <span class="classname">Shapes</span>. Since the
size of an array is fixed, a given array can only hold a certain maximum number
of items. In many cases, such an arbitrary limit is undesirable. Why should a
program work for 100 data values, but not for 101? The obvious alternative of
making an array that's so big that it will work in any practical case is not
usually a good solution to the problem. It means that in most cases, a lot of
computer memory will be wasted on unused space in the array. That memory might
be better used for something else. And what if someone is using a computer that
could handle as many data values as the user actually wants to process, but
doesn't have enough memory to accommodate all the extra space that you've
allocated for your huge array?</p>


<p>Clearly, it would be nice if we could increase the size of an array at will.
This is not possible, but what <b>is</b> possible is almost as good.
Remember that an array variable does not actually hold an array. It just holds
a reference to an array object. We can't make the array bigger, but we can make
a new, bigger array object and change the value of the array variable so that
it refers to the bigger array. Of course, we also have to copy the contents of
the old array into the new array. The array variable then refers to an array
object that contains all the data of the old array, with room for additional
data. The old array will be garbage collected, since it is no longer in
use.</p>


<p>Let's look back at the game example, in which <span class="code">playerList</span> is an
array of type <span class="atype">Player[]</span> and <span class="code">playerCt</span> is the number of spaces
that have been used in the array. Suppose that we don't want to put a pre-set
limit on the number of players. If a new player joins the game and the current
array is full, we just make a new, bigger one. The same variable,
<span class="code">playerList</span>, will refer to the new array. Note that after this is done,
<span class="code">playerList[0]</span> will refer to a different memory location, but the value
stored in <span class="code">playerList[0]</span> will still be the same as it was before. Here
is some code that will do this:</p>


<pre>// Add a new player, even if the current array is full.

if (playerCt == playerList.length) {
        // Array is full.  Make a new, bigger array,
        // copy the contents of the old array into it,
        // and set playerList to refer to the new array.
   int newSize = 2 * playerList.length;  // Size of new array.
   Player[] temp = new Player[newSize];  // The new array.
   System.arraycopy(playerList, 0, temp, 0, playerList.length);
   playerList = temp;  // Set playerList to refer to new array.
}

// At this point, we KNOW there is room in the array.

playerList[playerCt] = newPlayer; // Add the new player...
playerCt++;                       //    ...and count it.</pre>


<p>If we are going to be doing things like this regularly, it would be nice to
define a reusable class to handle the details. An array-like object that
changes size to accommodate the amount of data that it actually contains is
called a <span class="newword">dynamic array</span>. A dynamic array supports
the same operations as an array: putting a value at a given position and
getting the value that is stored at a given position. But there is no upper
limit on the positions that can be used (except those imposed by the size of
the computer's memory). In a dynamic array class, the <span class="code">put</span> and
<span class="code">get</span> operations must be implemented as instance methods. Here, for
example, is a class that implements a dynamic array of <span class="ptype">ints</span>:</p>


<pre>/**
 *  An object of type DynamicArrayOfInt acts like an array of int
 *  of unlimited size.  The notation A.get(i) must be used instead
 *  of A[i], and A.set(i,v) must be used instead of A[i] = v.
 */
public class DynamicArrayOfInt {

   private int[] data;  // An array to hold the data.

   /**
    * Constructor creates an array with an initial size of 1,
    * but the array size will be increased whenever a reference
    * is made to an array position that does not yet exist.
    */   
   public DynamicArrayOfInt() {
      data = new int[1];
   }
   
   /**
    *  Get the value from the specified position in the array.
    *  Since all array elements are initialized to zero, when the
    *  specified position lies outside the actual physical size
    *  of the data array, a value of 0 is returned.  Note that
    *  a negative value of position will still produce an
    *  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
    */
   public int get(int position) {
      if (position &gt;= data.length)
         return 0;
      else
         return data[position];
   }
   
   /**
    *  Store the value in the specified position in the array.
    *  The data array will increase in size to include this
    *  position, if necessary.
    */
   public void put(int position, int value) {
      if (position &gt;= data.length) {
             // The specified position is outside the actual size of
             // the data array.  Double the size, or if that still does
             // not include the specified position, set the new size
             // to 2*position. 
         int newSize = 2 * data.length;
         if (position &gt;= newSize)
            newSize = 2 * position;
         int[] newData = new int[newSize];
         System.arraycopy(data, 0, newData, 0, data.length);
         data = newData;
             // The following line is for demonstration purposes only !!
         System.out.println("Size of dynamic array increased to " + newSize);
      }
      data[position] = value;
   }

} // end class DynamicArrayOfInt</pre>


<p>The data in a <span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfInt</span> object is actually stored in a
regular array, but that array is discarded and replaced by a bigger array
whenever necessary. If <span class="code">numbers</span> is a variable of type
<span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfInt</span>, then the command <span class="code">numbers.put(pos,val)</span>
stores the value <span class="code">val</span> at position number <span class="code">pos</span> in the dynamic
array. The function <span class="code">numbers.get(pos)</span> returns the value stored at
position number <span class="code">pos</span>.</p>


<p>The first example in this section used an array to store positive integers
input by the user. We can rewrite that example to use a
<span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfInt</span>. A reference to <span class="code">numbers[i]</span> is replaced by
<span class="code">numbers.get(i)</span>. The statement "<span class="code">numbers[numCount] = num</span>;" is
replaced by "<span class="code">numbers.put(numCount,num);</span>". Here's the program:</p>


<pre>public class ReverseWithDynamicArray {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
  
      <span class="newcode">DynamicArrayOfInt</span> numbers;  // To hold the input numbers.
      int numCount;  // The number of numbers stored in the array.
      int num;    // One of the numbers input by the user.
    
      <span class="newcode">numbers = new DynamicArrayOfInt();</span>
      numCount = 0;
    
      TextIO.putln("Enter some positive integers; Enter 0 to end");
      while (true) {  // Get numbers and put them in the dynamic array.
         TextIO.put("? ");
         num = TextIO.getlnInt();
         if (num &lt;= 0)
            break;
         <span class="newcode">numbers.put(numCount, num);</span>  // Store num in the dynamic array.
         numCount++;
      }
    
      TextIO.putln("\nYour numbers in reverse order are:\n");
    
      for (int i = numCount - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
          TextIO.putln( <span class="newcode">numbers.get(i)</span> );  // Print the i-th number.
      }
    
   } // end main();
  
}  // end class ReverseWithDynamicArray</pre>


<p>The following applet simulates this program. I've included an output
statement in the <span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfInt</span> class. This statement will inform
you each time the data array increases in size. (Of course, the output
statement doesn't really belong in the class. It's included here for
demonstration purposes.)</p>

<p>The <span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfInt</span> class could be used in any situation where an
array of <span class="ptype">int</span> with no preset limit on the size is needed. However, if
we want to store <span class="classname">Shapes</span> instead of <span class="ptype">ints</span>, we would have to
define a new class to do it. That class, probably named
"<span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfShape</span>", would look exactly the same as the
<span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfInt</span> class except that everywhere the type "<span class="ptype">int</span>"
appears, it would be replaced by the type "<span class="classname">Shape</span>". Similarly, we could
define a <span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfDouble</span> class, a <span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfPlayer</span>
class, and so on. But there is something a little silly about this, since all
these classes are close to being identical. It would be nice to be able to
write some kind of source code, once and for all, that could be used to
generate any of these classes on demand, given the type of value that we want
to store. This would be an example of <span class="newword">generic programming</span>. 
Some programming languages, including C++, have had support for
generic programming for some time.  With version 5.0, Java introduced true
generic programming, but even before that it had something that was very
similar:  One can come close to generic programming in Java by working with 
data structures that contain elements of type <span class="classname">Object</span>.
We will first consider the almost-generic programming that has been available
in Java from the beginning, and then we will look at the change
that was introduced in Java 5.0.  A full discussion of generic programming
will be given in <a href="futurelink">Chapter 10</a>.</p>


<p>In Java, every class is a subclass of the class named <span class="classname">Object</span>. This
means that every object can be assigned to a variable of type <span class="classname">Object</span>.
Any object can be put into an array of type <span class="atype">Object[]</span>.  If we defined a
<span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfObject</span> class, then we could store objects of any type.
This is not true generic programming, and it doesn't apply to the primitive
types such as <span class="ptype">int</span> and <span class="ptype">double</span>. But it does come close. In
fact, there is no need for us to define a <span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfObject</span> class.
Java already has a standard class named <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> that serves much the
same purpose. The <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> class is in the package
<span class="code">java.util</span>, so if you want to use it in a
program, you should put the directive "<span class="code">import java.util.ArrayList;</span>"
at the beginning of your source code file.</p>


<p>The <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> class differs from my <span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfInt</span>
class in that an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> object always has a definite size, and it
is illegal to refer to a position in the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> that lies outside
its size. In this, an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> is more like a regular array. However,
the size of an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> can be increased at will. The
<span class="classname">ArrayList</span> class defines many instance methods. I'll describe some of
the most useful. Suppose that <span class="code">list</span> is a variable of type
<span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.  Then we have:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.size()</span>  --  This function returns
the current size of the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>. The only valid positions in the
list are numbers in the range <span class="code">0</span> to <span class="code">list.size()-1</span>. Note that
the size can be zero. A call to the default constructor <span class="code">new ArrayList()</span> 
creates an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> of size zero.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.add(obj)</span>  --  Adds an object onto
the end of the list, increasing the size by&nbsp;1. The parameter,
<span class="code">obj</span>, can refer to an object of any type, or it can be <span class="code">null</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.get(N)</span>  --  This function returns
the value stored at position <span class="code">N</span> in the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>. <span class="code">N</span>
must be an integer in the range <span class="code">0</span> to <span class="code">list.size()-1</span>. If
<span class="code">N</span> is outside this range, an error of type <span class="classname">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span>
occurs. Calling this function is
similar to referring to <span class="code">A[N]</span> for an array, <span class="code">A</span>, except that you
can't use <span class="code">list.get(N)</span> on the left side of an assignment statement.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.set(N, obj)</span>  --  Assigns the
object, <span class="code">obj</span>, to position <span class="code">N</span> in the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>,
replacing the item previously stored at position <span class="code">N</span>. The integer
<span class="code">N</span> must be in the range from <span class="code">0</span> to <span class="code">list.size()-1</span>. A
call to this function is equivalent to the command <span class="code">A[N]&nbsp;=&nbsp;obj</span> for an
array <span class="code">A</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.remove(obj)</span>  --  If the specified
object occurs somewhere in the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, it is removed from the list.
Any items in the list that come after the removed item are moved down one
position. The size of the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> decreases by 1. If <span class="code">obj</span>
occurs more than once in the list, only the first copy is removed.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.remove(N)</span>  --  For an integer,
<span class="code">N</span>, this removes the <span class="code">N-th</span> item in the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.
<span class="code">N</span> must be in the range <span class="code">0</span> to <span class="code">list.size()-1</span>. Any items
in the list that come after the removed item are moved down one position. The
size of the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> decreases by 1.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.indexOf(obj)</span>  --  A function that
searches for the object, <span class="code">obj</span>, in the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>. If the object
is found in the list, then the position number where it is found is returned.
If the object is not found, then <span class="code">-1</span> is returned.</li>

</ul>


<p>For example, suppose again that players in a game are represented by objects
of type <span class="classname">Player</span>. The players currently in the game could be stored in
an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> named <span class="code">players</span>. This variable would be declared
as</p>


<pre>ArrayList players;</pre>


<p>and initialized to refer to a new, empty <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> object with</p>


<pre>players = new ArrayList();</pre>


<p>If <span class="code">newPlayer</span> is a variable that refers to a <span class="classname">Player</span> object,
the new player would be added to the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> and to the game by
saying</p>


<pre>players.add(newPlayer);</pre>


<p>and if player number <span class="code">i</span> leaves the game, it is only necessary to
say</p>


<pre>players.remove(i);</pre>


<p>Or, if <span class="code">player</span> is a variable that refers to the <span class="classname">Player</span> that
is to be removed, you could say</p>


<pre>players.remove(player);</pre>


<p>All this works very nicely. The only slight difficulty arises when you use
the function <span class="code">players.get(i)</span> to get the value stored at position
<span class="code">i</span> in the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>. The return type of this function is
<span class="classname">Object</span>. In this case the object that is returned by the function is
actually of type <span class="classname">Player</span>. In order to do anything useful with the
returned value, it's usually necessary to type-cast it to type
<span class="classname">Player</span>:</p>


<pre>Player plr = (Player)players.get(i);</pre>


<p>For example, if the <span class="classname">Player</span> class includes an instance method
<span class="code">makeMove()</span> that is called to allow a player to make a move in the
game, then the code for letting every player make a move is</p>


<pre>for (int i = 0;  i &lt; players.size();  i++) {
    Player plr = (Player)players.get(i);
    plr.makeMove();
}</pre>


<p>The two lines inside the <span class="code">for</span> loop can be combined to a single
line:</p>


<pre>((Player)players.get(i)).makeMove();</pre>


<p>This gets an item from the list, type-casts it, and then calls the
<span class="code">makeMove()</span> method on the resulting <span class="classname">Player</span>. The parentheses
around "<span class="code">(Player)players.get(i)</span>" are required because of Java's
precedence rules. The parentheses force the type-cast to be performed before
the <span class="code">makeMove()</span> method is called.</p>
   

<p>For-each loops work for <span class="classname">ArrayLists</span> just as they do
for arrays.  But note that since the items in an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> are
only known to be <span class="classname">Objects</span>, the type of the loop control variable
must be <span class="classname">Object</span>.  For example, the <span class="code">for</span> loop
used above to let each <span class="classname">Player</span> make a move could be written
as the for-each loop</p>
   

<pre>for ( Object plrObj : players ) {
   Player plr = (Player)plrObj;
   plr.makeMove();
}</pre>
   

<p>In the body of the loop, the value of the loop control variable, <span class="code">plrObj</span>,
is one of the objects from the list, <span class="code">players</span>.  This object must be
type-cast to type <span class="classname">Player</span> before it can be used.</p>
   

<hr class="break">


<p>In <a href="../c5/s5.html#OOP.5.5">Subection&nbsp;5.5.5</a>, I discussed a program,
<span class="classname">ShapeDraw</span>, that uses <span class="classname">ArrayLists</span>. Here is another version of
the same idea, simplified to make it easier to see how <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> is
being used. The program supports the following operations: Click the large white drawing area to add a colored
rectangle.  (The color of the
rectangle is given by a "rainbow palette" along the bottom of the applet;
click the palette to select a new color.)  Drag rectangles using the
right mouse button.  Hold down the Alt key and click on a rectangle to
delete it. Shift-click a rectangle to move it out in front of all the other
rectangles.  You can try an applet version of the program here:</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="SimpleDrawRectsApplet.class" width="266" height="290" archive="SimpleDrawRects.jar" alt="(Applet 'SimpleDrawRects' should be displayed here.)"></applet></p>
   

<p>Source code for the main panel for this program can be found in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SimpleDrawRects.java">SimpleDrawRects.java</a></span>. You should be able
to follow the source code in its entirety. (You can also take a look at the file
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RainbowPalette.java">RainbowPalette.java</a></span>, which defines the color palette shown at the bottom of
the applet, if you like.) Here, I just
want to look at the parts of the program that use an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.</p>


<p>The applet uses a variable named <span class="code">rects</span>, of type <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>,
to hold information about the rectangles that have been added to the drawing
area. The objects that are stored in the list belong to a static nested class,
<span class="classname">ColoredRect</span>, that is defined as</p>


<pre>/**
 * An object of type ColoredRect holds the data for one colored rectangle.
 */
private static class ColoredRect {
   int x,y;           // Upper left corner of the rectangle.
   int width,height;  // Size of the rectangle.  
   Color color;       // Color of the rectangle.
}</pre>


<p>If <span class="code">g</span> is a variable of type <span class="code">Graphics</span>, then the following
code draws all the rectangles that are stored in the list <span class="code">rects</span> (with
a black outline around each rectangle):</p>


<pre>for (int i = 0;  i &lt; rects.size();  i++) {
   ColoredRect rect = (ColoredRect)rects.get(i);
   g.setColor( rect.color );
   g.fillRect( rect.x, rect.y, rect.width, rect.height);
   g.setColor( Color.BLACK );
   g.drawRect( rect.x, rect.y, rect.width - 1, rect.height - 1);
}</pre>
   

<p>The <span class="code">i</span>-th rectangle in the list is obtained by calling
<span class="code">rects.get(i)</span>.  Since this method returns a value of type
<span class="classname">Object</span>, the return value must be typecast
to its actual type, <span class="classname">ColoredRect</span>, to get
access to the data that it contains.</p>


<p>To implement the mouse operations, it must be possible to
find the rectangle, if any, that contains the point where the user clicked the
mouse. To do this, I wrote the function</p>


<pre>/**
 * Find the topmost rect that contains the point (x,y). Return null 
 * if no rect contains that point.  The rects in the ArrayList are 
 * considered in reverse order so that if one lies on top of another, 
 * the one on top is seen first and is returned.
 */
ColoredRect findRect(int x, int y) {

   for (int i = rects.size() - 1;  i &gt;= 0;  i--) {
      ColoredRect rect = (ColoredRect)rects.get(i);
      if ( x &gt;= rect.x &amp;&amp; x &lt; rect.x + rect.width
               &amp;&amp; y &gt;= rect.y &amp;&amp; y &lt; rect.y + rect.height )
      return rect;  // (x,y) is inside this rect.
   }
   
   return null;  // No rect containing (x,y) was found.
   
}</pre>
   


<p>The code for removing a <span class="code">ColoredRect</span>, <span class="code">rect</span>, from the
drawing area is simply <span class="code">rects.remove(rect)</span> (followed by a
<span class="code">repaint()</span>). Bringing a given rectangle out in front of all the other
rectangles is just a little harder. Since the rectangles are drawn in the order
in which they occur in the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, the rectangle that is in the
last position in the list is in front of all the other rectangles on the
screen. So we need to move the selected rectangle to the last position in the list. This
can most easily be done in a slightly tricky way using built-in <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>
operations: The rectangle is simply removed from its current position in the list and
then adding back at the end of the list:</p>


<pre>void bringToFront(ColoredRect rect) {
   if (rect != null) {
      rects.remove(rect); // Remove rect from the list.
      rects.add(rect);    // Add it back; it will be placed in the last position.
      repaint();
   }
}</pre>


<p>This should be enough to give you the basic idea. You can look in the source
code for more details.</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.3.4">7.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameterized Types</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The main difference between true generic programming and the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>
examples in the previous subsection is the use of the type <span class="classname">Object</span>
as the basic type for objects that are stored in a list.  This has at least two unfortunate
consequences:  First, it makes it necessary to use type-casting in almost every
case when an element is retrieved from that list.  Second, since any type of object
can legally be added to the list, there is no way for the compiler to detect an attempt
to add the wrong type of object to the list; the error will be detected only at
run time when the object is retrieved from the list and the attempt to type-cast
the object fails.  Compare this to arrays.  An array of type <span class="atype">BaseType[]</span>
can <b>only</b> hold objects of type <span class="classname">BaseType</span>.  An attempt
to store an object of the wrong type in the array will be detected by the compiler,
and there is no need to type-cast items that are retrieved from the array back to
type <span class="classname">BaseType</span>.</p>


<p>To address this problem, Java 5.0 introduced <span class="newword">parameterized types</span>.
<span class="classname">ArrayList</span> is an example:  Instead of using the plain
"ArrayList" type, it is possible to use <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;BaseType&gt;</span>,
where <span class="classname">BaseType</span> is any object type, that is, the name of
a class or of an interface.  (<span class="classname">BaseType</span> <b>cannot</b> be one
of the primitive types.)  <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;BaseType&gt;</span> can be
used to create lists that can hold only objects of type <span class="classname">BaseType</span>.
For example,</p>
   

<pre>ArrayList&lt;ColoredRect&gt; rects;</pre>   


<p>declares a variable named <span class="code">rects</span> of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;ColoredRect&gt;</span>, and</p>
   

<pre>rects  =  new ArrayList&lt;ColoredRect&gt;();</pre>
   

<p>sets <span class="code">rects</span> to refer to a newly created list that can only
hold objects belonging to the class <span class="classname">ColoredRect</span> (or to
a subclass).  The funny-looking name "ArrayList&lt;ColoredRect&gt;" is being
used here in exactly the same way as an ordinary class name -- don't let
the "&lt;ColoredRect&gt;" confuse you; it's just part of the name of the type.
When a statements such as <span class="code">rects.add(x);</span> occurs
in the program, the compiler can check whether <span class="code">x</span> is in fact
of type <span class="classname">ColoredRect</span>.  If not, the compiler will
report a syntax error.  When an object is retrieve from the list, the
compiler knows that the object must be of type <span class="classname">ColoredRect</span>,
so no type-cast is necessary.  You can say simply:</p>
   

<pre>ColoredRect rect = rects.get(i)</pre>
   

<p>You can even refer directly to an instance variable in the object,
such as <span class="code">rects.get(i).color</span>.
This makes using <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;ColoredRect&gt;</span> very
similar to using <span class="atype">ColoredRect[]</span> with the added advantage that the
list can grow to any size.  Note that if a for-each loop is used to process
the items in <span class="code">rects</span>, the type of the loop control variable can
be <span class="classname">ColoredRect</span>, and no type-cast is necessary.  For
example, when using <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;ColoredRect&gt;</span> as the
type for the list <span class="code">rects</span>, the code for drawing all the rectangles
in the list could be rewritten as:</p>


<pre>for ( ColoredRect rect : rects ) {
   g.setColor( rect.color );
   g.fillRect( rect.x, rect.y, rect.width, rect.height);
   g.setColor( Color.BLACK );
   g.drawRect( rect.x, rect.y, rect.width - 1, rect.height - 1);
}</pre>
   

<p>You can use <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;ColoredRect&gt;</span> anyplace where you could
use a normal type:  to declare variables, as the type of a formal parameter in
a subroutine, or as the return type of a subroutine.  You can even create a
subclass of <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;ColoredRect&gt;</span>!  (Nevertheless,
technically speaking, <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;ColoredRect&gt;</span> is not
considered to be a separate class from <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.
An object of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;ColoredRect&gt;</span> actually belongs to
the class <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, but the compiler restricts the type
of objects that can be added to the list.)</p>
   

<p>The only drawback to
using parameterized types is that the base type cannot be a primitive type.
For example, there is no such thing as "<span class="code">ArrayList&lt;int&gt;</span>".
However, this is not such a big drawback as it might seem at first, because
of the "wrapper types" and "autoboxing" that were introduced in <a href="../c5/s3.html#OOP.3.2">Subection&nbsp;5.3.2</a>.
A wrapper type such as <span class="classname">Double</span> or <span class="classname">Integer</span>
can be used as a base type for a parameterized type.  An object
of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;</span> can hold objects of type
<span class="classname">Double</span>.  Since each object of type <span class="classname">Double</span>
holds a value of type <span class="ptype">double</span>, it's almost like having a list
of <span class="ptype">doubles</span>.  If <span class="code">numlist</span> is declared to be of
type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;</span> and if <span class="code">x</span> is of type
<span class="ptype">double</span>, then the value of <span class="code">x</span> can be added to the list
by saying:</p>
   

<pre>numlist.add( new Double(x) );</pre>


<p>Furthermore, because of autoboxing, the compiler will automatically do
<span class="ptype">double</span>-to-<span class="classname">Double</span> and
<span class="classname">Double</span>-to-<span class="ptype">double</span> type conversions
when necessary.  This means that the compiler will treat "<span class="code">numlist.add(x)</span>"
as begin equivalent to "<span class="code">numlist.add( new Double(x)&nbsp;)</span>".  So, behind
the scenes, "<span class="code">numlist.add(x)</span>" is actually adding an object to the
list, but it looks a lot as if you are working with a list of <span class="ptype">doubles</span>.</p>


<hr class="break">
   

<p>The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SimplePaint2.java">SimplePaint2.java</a></span> demonstrates the use
of parameterized types.  In this program, the user can sketch curves in a drawing area
by clicking and dragging with the mouse.  The curves can be of any color, and
the user can select the drawing color using a menu.  The background color of the
drawing area can also be selected using a menu.  And there is a "Control"
menu that contains several commands:  An "Undo" command, which removes the
most recently drawn curve from the screen, a "Clear" command that removes
all the curves, and a "Use Symmetry" command that turns a symmetry feature
on and off.  Curves that are drawn by the user when the symmetry option is on
are reflected horizontally and vertically to produce a symmetric pattern.
You can try an applet version of the program here:</p>

   

<p align="center">
<applet code="SimplePaint2$Applet.class" width="400" height="400" archive="SimplePaint2.jar" alt="Applet 'SimplePaint2' should appear here."></applet></p>

   

<p>Unlike the original SimplePaint program in <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.4">Subection&nbsp;6.4.4</a>, this new version
uses a data structure to store information about the picture that has been
drawn by the user.  This data is used in the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method
to redraw the picture whenever necessary.  Thus, the picture doesn't disappear
when, for example, the picture is covered and then uncovered.  The data
structure is implemented using <span class="classname">ArrayLists</span>.</p>
   

<p>The main data for a curve consists of a list of the points on the curve.  This
data can be stored in an object of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Point&gt;</span>,
where <span class="code">java.awt.Point</span> is one of Java's standard classes.
(A <span class="classname">Point</span> object contains two public integer variables
<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> that represent the coordinates of a
point.)  However, to redraw the curve, we also need to know its color,
and we need to know whether the symmetry option should be applied to the curve.
All the data that is needed to redraw the curve can be grouped into
an object of type <span class="classname">CurveData</span> that is defined as</p>
   

<pre>private static class CurveData {
   Color color;  // The color of the curve.
   boolean symmetric;  // Are horizontal and vertical reflections also drawn?
   ArrayList&lt;Point&gt; points;  // The points on the curve.
}</pre>
   

<p>However, a picture can contain many curves, not just one, so to store
all the data necessary to redraw the entire picture, we need a <b>list</b>
of objects of type <span class="classname">CurveData</span>.  For this list,
we can use a variable <span class="code">curves</span> declared as</p>
   
   

<pre>ArrayList&lt;CurveData&gt; curves = new ArrayList&lt;CurveData&gt;();</pre>
   

<p>Here we have a list of objects, where each object contains a list of
points as part of its data!  Let's look at a few examples of processing
this data structure.  When the user clicks the mouse on the drawing surface,
it's the start of a new curve, and a new <span class="classname">CurveData</span>
object must be created and added to the list of curves.  The instance
variables in the new <span class="classname">CurveData</span> object must
also be initialized.  Here is the code from the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span>
routine that does this:</p>
     

<pre>
currentCurve = new CurveData();        // Create a new CurveData object.

currentCurve.color = currentColor;     // The color of the curve is taken from an
                                       // instance variable that represents the
                                       // currently selected drawing color.

currentCurve.symmetric = useSymmetry;  // The "symmetric" property of the curve
                                       // is also copied from the current value
                                       // of an instance variable, useSymmetry.

currentCurve.points = new ArrayList&lt;Point&gt;();  // Create a new point list object.

currentCurve.points.add( new Point(evt.getX(), evt.getY()) );
           // The point where the user pressed the mouse is the first point on
           // the curve.  A new Point object is created to hold the coordinates
           // of that point and is added to the list of points for the curve.
   
curves.add(currentCurve);   // Add the CurveData object to the list of curves.</pre>
   

<p>As the user drags the mouse, new points are added to <span class="code">currentCurve</span>,
and <span class="code">repaint()</span> is called.  When the picture is redrawn, the new
point will be part of the picture.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method has to use the data in <span class="code">curves</span>
to draw all the curves.  The basic structure is a for-each loop that processes
the data for each individual curve in turn.  This has the form:</p>
   

<pre>for ( CurveData curve : curves ) {
   .
   .  // Draw the curve represented by the object, curve, of type CurveData.
   .  
}</pre>
   

<p>In the body of this loop, <span class="code">curve.points</span> is a variable of
type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Point&gt;</span> that holds the list of 
points on the curve.  The <span class="code">i-th</span> point on the curve can be
obtained by calling the <span class="code">get()</span> method of this list:
<span class="code">curve.points.get(i)</span>.  This returns a value of type
<span class="classname">Point</span> which contains instance variables named
<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span>.  We can refer directly to the
x-coordinate of the <span class="code">i-th</span> point as:</p>
   

<pre>curve.points.get(i).x</pre>
   

<p>This might seem rather complicated, but it's a nice example of a complex name
that specifies a path to a desired piece of data: Go to the object, <span class="code">curve</span>.
Inside <span class="code">curve</span>, go to <span class="code">points</span>.  Inside <span class="code">points</span>,
get the <span class="code">i-th</span> item.  And from that item, get the instance variable
named&nbsp;<span class="code">x</span>.  Here is the complete definition of the
<span class="code">paintCompontent()</span> method:</p>
   

<pre>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
   super.paintComponent(g);
   for ( CurveData curve : curves) {
      g.setColor(curve.color);
      for (int i = 1; i &lt; curve.points.size(); i++) {
            // Draw a line segment from point number i-1 to point number i.
         int x1 = curve.points.get(i-1).x;
         int y1 = curve.points.get(i-1).y;
         int x2 = curve.points.get(i).x;
         int y2 = curve.points.get(i).y;
         g.drawLine(x1,y1,x2,y2);
         if (curve.symmetric) {
               // Also draw the horizontal and vertical reflections
               // of the line segment.
            int w = getWidth();
            int h = getHeight();
            g.drawLine(w-x1,y1,w-x2,y2);
            g.drawLine(x1,h-y1,x2,h-y2);
            g.drawLine(w-x1,h-y1,w-x2,h-y2);
         }
      }
   }
} // end paintComponent()</pre>

<a name="arrays.3.5">7.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Vectors</a>
</h3>


<p>The <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> class was introduced in Java version 1.2, as one of a
group of classes designed for working with collections of objects. We'll look
at these "collection classes" in <a href="futurelink">Chapter 10</a>.
Early versions of Java did not include <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, but they did have
a very similar class named <span class="code">java.util.Vector</span>. You can still see
<span class="classname">Vectors</span> used in older code and in many of Java's standard classes, so
it's worth knowing about them. Using a <span class="classname">Vector</span> is similar to using an
<span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, except that different names are used for some commonly used
instance methods, and some instance methods in one class don't correspond to
any instance method in the other class.</p>


<p>Like an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, a <span class="classname">Vector</span> is similar to an array of
<span class="classname">Objects</span> that can grow to be as large as necessary. The default
constructor, <span class="code">new&nbsp;Vector()</span>, creates a vector with no elements.
Suppose that <span class="code">vec</span> is a <span class="classname">Vector</span>. Then we have:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">vec.size()</span>  --  a function that returns the number of elements
currently in the vector.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">vec.addElement(obj)</span>  --  adds the <span class="classname">Object</span>, <span class="code">obj</span>, to
the end of the vector. This is the same as the <span class="code">add()</span> method of an
<span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">vec.removeElement(obj)</span>  --  removes <span class="code">obj</span> from the vector, if it
occurs. Only the first occurrence is removed. This is the same as
<span class="code">remove(obj)</span> for an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">vec.removeElementAt(N)</span>  --  removes the <span class="code">N-th</span> element, for an
integer <span class="code">N</span>. <span class="code">N</span> must be in the range 0 to <span class="code">vec.size()-1</span>.
This is the same as <span class="code">remove(N)</span> for an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">vec.setSize(N)</span>  --  sets the size of the vector to <span class="code">N</span>. If there
were more than <span class="code">N</span> elements in <span class="code">vec</span>, the extra elements are
removed. If there were fewer than <span class="code">N</span> elements, extra spaces are filled
with <span class="code">null</span>. The <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> class, unfortunately, does not have a
<span class="code">setSize()</span> method.</li>

</ul>


<p>The <span class="classname">Vector</span> class includes many more methods, but these are probably
the most commonly used.  Note that in Java 5.0, <span class="classname">Vector</span> can be used
as a paraterized type in exactly the same way as <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.
That is, if <span class="classname">BaseType</span> is any class or interface name, then
<span class="atype">Vector&lt;BaseType&gt;</span> represents vectors that can hold only objects of type
<span class="classname">BaseType</span>.</p>
