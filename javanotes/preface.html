<p>
<span class="start"><big>I</big>ntroduction to Programming Using Java</span> is a free
introductory computer programming textbook that uses Java as the language of
instruction.  It is suitable for use in an introductory programming course
and for people who are trying to learn programming on their own. 
The Fifth Edition of this textbook is still under construction.  Part&nbsp;I, which
consists of Chapters 1 through 7, contains enough material for a one-semester
introductory programming course. There are
no prerequisites beyond a general familiarity with the ideas of computers and
programs.</p>


<p>This version of the book covers "Java&nbsp;5.0", and many of the examples
use features that were not present in earlier versions of Java.  (Sometimes,
you will see this version of Java referred to as Java 1.5 instead of Java&nbsp;5.0.)
Part I of the book is available in an on-line version at</p>

<p>In style, this is a textbook rather than a tutorial. That is, it
concentrates on explaining concepts rather than giving step-by-step
how-to-do-it guides. I have tried to use a conversational writing style that
might be closer to classroom lecture than to a typical textbook. You'll find
programming exercises at the end of most chapters, and you will find a detailed
solution for each exercise, with the sort of discussion that I would give if I
presented the solution in class. (I <b>strongly</b> advise that you read the
exercise solutions if you want to get the most out of this book.) This is
certainly <b>not</b> a Java reference book, and it is not even close to a
comprehensive survey of all the features of Java. It is <b>not</b> written as
a quick introduction to Java for people who already know another programming
language. Instead, it is directed mainly towards people who are learning
programming for the first time, and it is as much about general programming
concepts as it is about Java in particular. I believe that <i>Introduction to
Programming using Java</i> is fully competitive with the conventionally
published, printed programming textbooks that are available on the market.
(Well, all right, I'll confess that I think it's better.)</p>


<p>There are several approaches to teaching Java. One approach uses applets and
graphical user interface programming from the very beginning. Some people
believe that object oriented programming should also be emphasized from the
very beginning. This is not the approach that I take. The approach that I favor
starts with the more basic building blocks of programming and builds from
there. I cover procedural programming in Chapters 2, 3, and&nbsp;4.
Object-oriented programming is introduced in Chapter&nbsp;5. Chapters 6
covers the closely related topic of event-oriented programming and
graphical user interfaces. Arrays are covered in Chapter&nbsp;7.
The second part of the book, which is not yet finished, will probably
include the following chapters:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<b>Chapter 8:</b> Correctness and Robustness (Introduction to Software Engineering)</li> 

<li>
<b>Chapter 9:</b> Linked Data Structures and Recursion</li> 

<li>
<b>Chapter 10:</b> Generic Programming and Collection Classes</li> 

<li>
<b>Chapter 11:</b> Files and Networking</li> 

<li>
<b>Chapter 12:</b> Advanced GUI Programming</li> 

<li>
<b>Chapter 13:</b> Server Side Programming</li> 

</ul>

<p>The latest complete edition of <i>Introduction to Programming using Java</i> is always available on line at
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/">http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/</a>.  Currently, the edition at that
address is Version 4.1, from June 2004.  The first version of the book was written in 1996, and there have
been several editions since then.  Older editions are permanently archived at the following Web
