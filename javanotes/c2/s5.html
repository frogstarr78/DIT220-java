<h2 class="section_title">Details of Expressions</h2>
<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his section takes a closer look</span> at expressions.
Recall that an expression is a piece of program code that represents or
computes a value. An expression can be a literal, a variable, a function call,
or several of these things combined with operators such as <span class="code">+</span> and
<span class="code">&gt;</span>. The value of an expression can be assigned to a variable, used
as a parameter in a  subroutine call, or combined with other values into a
more complicated expression. (The value can even, in some cases, be ignored, if
that's what you want to do; this is more common than you might think.)
Expressions are an essential part of programming. So far, these notes have
dealt only informally with expressions. This section tells you the more-or-less
complete story (leaving out some of the less commonly used operators).</p>


<p>The basic building blocks of expressions are literals (such as <span class="code">674</span>,
<span class="code">3.14</span>, <span class="code">true</span>, and <span class="code">'X'</span>), variables, and function calls.
Recall that a function is a subroutine that returns a value. You've already
seen some examples of functions, such as the input routines from the <span class="classname">TextIO</span>
class and the mathematical functions from the <span class="classname">Math</span> class.
</p>
   

<p>The <span class="classname">Math</span> class also contains a couple of mathematical constants
that are useful in mathematical expressions:  <span class="code">Math.PI</span> represents
Ï€ (the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
diameter), and <span class="code">Math.E</span> represents <i>e</i> (the base of the natural
logarithms).  These "constants" are actually member variables in 
<span class="classname">Math</span> of type <span class="ptype">double</span>.  They are only
approximations for the mathematical constants, which would require an infinite
number of digits to specify exactly.</p>


<p>Literals, variables, and function calls are simple expressions. More complex
expressions can be built up by using <span class="newword">operators</span> to
combine simpler expressions. Operators include <span class="code">+</span> for adding two
numbers, <span class="code">&gt;</span> for comparing two values, and so on. When several
operators appear in an expression, there is a question of <span class="newword">precedence</span>, 
which determines how the operators are grouped for
evaluation. For example, in the expression "<span class="code">A + B * C</span>", <span class="code">B*C</span>
is computed first and then the result is added to <span class="code">A</span>. We say that
multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>) has <span class="newword">higher precedence</span>
than addition (<span class="code">+</span>). If the default precedence is not what you want, you
can use parentheses to explicitly specify the grouping you want. For example,
you could use "<span class="code">(A + B) * C</span>" if you want to add <span class="code">A</span> to
<span class="code">B</span> first and then multiply the result by <span class="code">C</span>.</p>


<p>The rest of this section gives details of operators in Java. The number of
operators in Java is quite large, and I will not cover them all here. Most of
the important ones are here; a few will be covered in later chapters as they
become relevant.</p>

 

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.5.1">2.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Arithmetic Operators</a>
</h3>


<p>Arithmetic operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. They are indicated by <span class="code">+</span>, <span class="code">-</span>, <span class="code">*</span>, and
<span class="code">/</span>. These operations can be used on values of any numeric type:
<span class="ptype">byte</span>, <span class="ptype">short</span>, <span class="ptype">int</span>, <span class="ptype">long</span>, <span class="ptype">float</span>, or
<span class="ptype">double</span>. When the computer actually calculates one of these operations,
the two values that it combines must be of the same type. If your program tells
the computer to combine two values of different types, the computer will
convert one of the values from one type to another. For example, to compute
37.4 + 10, the computer will convert the integer 10 to a real number 10.0 and
will then compute 37.4 + 10.0.  This is called a <span class="newword">type conversion</span>.
Ordinarily, you don't have to worry about type conversion in expressions,
because the computer does it automatically.</p>


<p>When two numerical values are combined (after doing type conversion on one
of them, if necessary), the answer will be of the same type. If you multiply
two <span class="ptype">int</span>s, you get an <span class="ptype">int</span>; if you multiply two
<span class="ptype">double</span>s, you get a <span class="ptype">double</span>. This is what you would expect, but
you have to be very careful when you use the division operator <span class="code">/</span>. When
you divide two integers, the answer will always be an integer; if the quotient
has a fractional part, it is discarded. For example, the value of <span class="code">7/2</span>
is <span class="code">3</span>, not <span class="code">3.5</span>. If <span class="code">N</span> is an integer variable, then
<span class="code">N/100</span> is an integer, and <span class="code">1/N</span> is equal to zero for any
<span class="code">N</span> greater than one! This fact is a common source of programming
errors. You can force the computer to compute a real number as the answer by
making one of the operands real: For example, when the computer evaluates
<span class="code">1.0/N</span>, it first converts <span class="code">N</span> to a real number in order to match
the type of <span class="code">1.0</span>, so you get a real number as the answer.
</p>


<p>Java also has an operator for computing the remainder when one integer is
divided by another. This operator is indicated by <span class="code">%</span>. If <span class="code">A</span> and
<span class="code">B</span> are integers, then <span class="code">A&nbsp;%&nbsp;B</span> represents the remainder when
<span class="code">A</span> is divided by <span class="code">B</span>.  (However, for negative operands, <span class="code">%</span> is not quite the
same as the usual mathematical "modulus" operator, since if one of <span class="code">A</span> or
<span class="code">B</span> is negative, then the value of <span class="code">A&nbsp;%&nbsp;B</span> will be negative.)
For example, <span class="code">7&nbsp;%&nbsp;2</span> is <span class="code">1</span>,
while <span class="code">34577&nbsp;%&nbsp;100</span> is <span class="code">77</span>, and <span class="code">50&nbsp;%&nbsp;8</span> is <span class="code">2</span>. A
common use of <span class="code">%</span> is to test whether a given integer is even or odd.
<span class="code">N</span> is even if <span class="code">N&nbsp;%&nbsp;2</span> is zero, and it is odd if <span class="code">N&nbsp;%&nbsp;2</span>
is <span class="code">1</span>. More generally, you can check whether an integer <span class="code">N</span> is
evenly divisible by an integer <span class="code">M</span> by checking whether
<span class="code">N&nbsp;%&nbsp;M</span> is zero.</p>


<p>Finally, you might need the <span class="newword">unary minus</span>
operator, which takes the negative of a number. For example, <span class="code">-X</span> has
the same value as <span class="code">(-1)*X</span>. For completeness, Java also has a unary plus
operator, as in <span class="code">+X</span>, even though it doesn't really do anything.</p>


<p>By the way, recall that the <span class="code">+</span> operator can also be used to concatenate
a value of any type onto a <span class="classname">String</span>.  This is another example of
type conversion.  In Java, any type can be automatically converted into type
<span class="classname">String</span>.</p>
   



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.5.2">2.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Increment and Decrement</a>
</h3>


<p>You'll find that adding <span class="code">1</span> to a variable is an extremely common
operation in programming. Subtracting <span class="code">1</span> from a variable is also pretty
common. You might perform the operation of adding <span class="code">1</span> to a variable with
assignment statements such as:</p>


<pre>counter  =  counter + 1;
goalsScored  =  goalsScored + 1;</pre>


<p>The effect of the assignment statement <span class="code">x = x + 1</span> is to take the old
value of the variable <span class="code">x</span>, compute the result of adding <span class="code">1</span> to
that value, and store the answer as the new value of <span class="code">x</span>. The same
operation can be accomplished by writing <span class="code">x++</span> (or, if you prefer,
<span class="code">++x</span>). This actually changes the value of <span class="code">x</span>, so that it has
the same effect as writing "<span class="code">x = x + 1</span>". The two statements above could
be written</p>


<pre>counter++;
goalsScored++;</pre>


<p>Similarly, you could write <span class="code">x--</span> (or <span class="code">--x</span>) to subtract
<span class="code">1</span> from <span class="code">x</span>. That is, <span class="code">x--</span> performs the same computation
as <span class="code">x = x - 1</span>. Adding <span class="code">1</span> to a variable is called 
<span class="newword">incrementing</span> that variable, and subtracting <span class="code">1</span> is
called <span class="newword">decrementing</span>. The operators <span class="code">++</span> and
<span class="code">--</span> are called the increment operator and the decrement operator,
respectively. These operators can be used on variables belonging to any of the
numerical types and also on variables of type <span class="ptype">char</span>.</p>


<p>Usually, the operators <span class="code">++</span> or <span class="code">--</span> are used in statements
like "<span class="code">x++</span>;" or "<span class="code">x--</span>;". These statements are commands to
change the value of <span class="code">x</span>. However, it is also legal to use <span class="code">x++</span>,
<span class="code">++x</span>, <span class="code">x--</span>, or <span class="code">--x</span> as expressions, or as parts of
larger expressions. That is, you can write things like:</p>


<pre>y = x++;
y = ++x;
TextIO.putln(--x);
z = (++x) * (y--);</pre>


<p>The statement "<span class="code">y = x++</span>;" has the effects of adding <span class="code">1</span> to
the value of <span class="code">x</span> and, in addition, assigning some value to <span class="code">y</span>.
The value assigned to <span class="code">y</span> is the value of the expression <span class="code">x++</span>,
which is defined to be the <b>old</b> value of <span class="code">x</span>, before the
<span class="code">1</span> is added. Thus, if the value of <span class="code">x</span> is <span class="code">6</span>, the
statement "<span class="code">y = x++</span>;" will change the value of <span class="code">x</span> to
<span class="code">7</span>, but it will change the value of <span class="code">y</span> to <span class="code">6</span> since the
value assigned to <span class="code">y</span> is the <b>old</b> value of <span class="code">x</span>. On the
other hand, the value of <span class="code">++x</span> is defined to be the <b>new</b>
value of <span class="code">x</span>, after the <span class="code">1</span> is added. So if <span class="code">x</span> is
<span class="code">6</span>, then the statement "<span class="code">y = ++x</span>;" changes the values of both
<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> to <span class="code">7</span>. The decrement operator, <span class="code">--</span>,
works in a similar way.</p>


<p>This can be confusing. My advice is: Don't be confused. Use <span class="code">++</span> and
<span class="code">--</span> only in stand-alone statements, not in expressions. I will follow
this advice in all the examples in these notes.</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.5.3">2.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Relational Operators</a>
</h3>


<p>Java has boolean variables and boolean-valued expressions that can be used
to express conditions that can be either <span class="code">true</span> or <span class="code">false</span>. One
way to form a boolean-valued expression is to compare two values using a
<span class="newword">relational operator</span>. Relational operators are used
to test whether two values are equal, whether one value is greater than
another, and so forth. The relation operators in Java are: <span class="code">==</span>,
<span class="code">!=</span>, <span class="code">&lt;</span>, <span class="code">&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;=</span>, and <span class="code">&gt;=</span>.
The meanings of these operators are:</p>


<pre>A == B       Is A "equal to" B?
A != B       Is A "not equal to" B?
A &lt; B        Is A "less than" B?
A &gt; B        Is A "greater than" B?
A &lt;= B       Is A "less than or equal to" B?
A &gt;= B       Is A "greater than or equal to" B?</pre>


<p>These operators can be used to compare values of any of the numeric types.
They can also be used to compare values of type <span class="ptype">char</span>. For characters,
<span class="code">&lt;</span> and <span class="code">&gt;</span> are defined according the numeric Unicode
values of the characters. (This might not always be what you want. It is not
the same as alphabetical order because all the upper case letters come before
all the lower case letters.)</p>


<p>When using boolean expressions, you should remember that as far as the
computer is concerned, there is nothing special about boolean values. In the
next chapter, you will see how to use them in loop and branch statements. But
you can also assign boolean-valued expressions to boolean variables, just as
you can assign numeric values to numeric variables.</p>


<p>By the way, the operators <span class="code">==</span> and <span class="code">!=</span> can be used to compare boolean values.
This is occasionally useful. For example, can you figure out what this
does:</p>


<pre>boolean sameSign;
sameSign = ((x &gt; 0) == (y &gt; 0));</pre>


<p>One thing that you <b>cannot</b> do with the relational operators
<span class="code">&lt;</span>, <span class="code">&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;=</span>, and <span class="code">&lt;=</span> is to use them
to compare values of type <span class="classname">String</span>. You can legally use <span class="code">==</span> and
<span class="code">!=</span> to compare <span class="code">Strings</span>, but because of peculiarities in the
way objects behave, they might not give the results you want. (The <span class="code">==</span>
operator checks whether two objects are stored in the same memory location,
rather than whether they contain the same value. Occasionally, for some
objects, you do want to make such a check -- but rarely for strings. I'll get
back to this in a later chapter.) Instead, you should use the subroutines
<span class="code">equals()</span>, <span class="code">equalsIgnoreCase()</span>, and <span class="code">compareTo()</span>, which
were described in <a href="../c2/s3.html">Section&nbsp;2.3</a>, to compare two
<span class="code">Strings</span>.</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.5.4">2.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Boolean Operators</a>
</h3>


<p>In English, complicated conditions can be formed using the words "and",
"or", and "not." For example, "If there is a test <b>and</b> you did <b>not</b>
study for it...". "And", "or", and "not" are <span class="newword">boolean operators</span>, and they exist
in Java as well as in English.</p>


<p>In Java, the boolean operator "and" is represented by <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>.
The <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span> operator is used to combine two boolean values. The
result is also a boolean value. The result is <span class="code">true</span> if <b>both</b> of
the combined values are <span class="code">true</span>, and the result is <span class="code">false</span> if
<b>either</b> of the combined values is <span class="code">false</span>. For example, "<span class="code">(x ==
0) &amp;&amp; (y == 0)</span>" is <span class="code">true</span> if and only if both <span class="code">x</span> is
equal to 0 and <span class="code">y</span> is equal to&nbsp;0.</p>


<p>The boolean operator "or" is represented by <span class="code">||</span>. (That's supposed to
be two of the vertical line characters, <span class="code">|</span>.) The expression "<span class="code">A ||
B</span>" is <span class="code">true</span> if either <span class="code">A</span> is <span class="code">true</span> or <span class="code">B</span> is
<span class="code">true</span>, or if both are true. "<span class="code">A || B</span>" is <span class="code">false</span> only if
both <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are false.</p>


<p>The operators <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span> and <span class="code">||</span> are said to be
<span class="newword">short-circuited</span> versions of the boolean operators.
This means that the second operand of <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span> or <span class="code">||</span> is not
necessarily evaluated. Consider the test</p>


<pre>(x != 0) &amp;&amp; (y/x &gt; 1)</pre>


<p>Suppose that the value of <span class="code">x</span> is in fact zero. In that case, the
division <span class="code">y/x</span> is undefined mathmatically.
However, the computer will never perform the division, since when the computer
evaluates <span class="code">(x != 0)</span>, it finds that the result is <span class="code">false</span>, and so
it knows that (<span class="code">(x&nbsp;!=&nbsp;0)&nbsp;&amp;&amp;</span>&nbsp;<b>anything</b>) has to
be false. Therefore, it doesn't bother to evaluate the second operand, <span class="code">(y/x&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1)</span>.
The evaluation has been short-circuited and the division by zero
is avoided. Without the short-circuiting, there would have been a
division by zero. (This may seem like a technicality, and it is. But at
times, it will make your programming life a little easier.)</p>


<p>The boolean operator "not" is a unary operator. In Java, it is indicated by
<span class="code">!</span> and is written in front of its single operand. For example, if
<span class="code">test</span> is a boolean variable, then</p>


<pre>test = ! test;</pre>


<p>will reverse the value of test, changing it from <span class="code">true</span> to
<span class="code">false</span>, or from <span class="code">false</span> to <span class="code">true</span>.</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.5.5">2.5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditional Operator</a>
</h3>


<p>Any good programming language has some nifty little features that aren't
really necessary but that let you feel cool when you use them. Java has the
conditional operator. It's a ternary operator -- that is, it has three operands -- and
it comes in two pieces, ? and :, that have to be used together. It takes
the form</p>


<pre>
<span class="bnf"><b>boolean-expression</b></span> ? <span class="bnf"><b>expression1</b></span> : <span class="bnf"><b>expression2</b></span>
</pre>


<p>The computer tests the value of <span class="bnf"><b>boolean-expression</b></span>. If the value is <span class="code">true</span>, it
evaluates <span class="bnf"><b>expression1</b></span>; otherwise, it evaluates
<span class="bnf"><b>expression2</b></span>. For example:</p>


<pre>next = (N % 2 == 0) ? (N/2) : (3*N+1);</pre>


<p>will assign the value <span class="code">N/2</span> to <span class="code">next</span> if <span class="code">N</span> is even
(that is, if <span class="code">N&nbsp;%&nbsp;2&nbsp;==&nbsp;0</span> is <span class="code">true</span>), and it will assign the
value <span class="code">(3*N+1)</span> to <span class="code">next</span> if <span class="code">N</span> is odd.  (The parentheses
in this example are not required, but they do make the expression easier to read.)</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.5.6">2.5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment Operators and Type-Casts</a>
</h3>


<p>You are already familiar with the assignment statement, which uses the
symbol "=" to assign the value of an expression to a variable. In fact, = is
really an operator in the sense that an assignment can itself be used as an
expression or as part of a more complex expression. The value of an assignment
such as <span class="code">A=B</span> is the same as the value that is assigned to <span class="code">A</span>.
So, if you want to assign the value of <span class="code">B</span> to <span class="code">A</span> and test at the
same time whether that value is zero, you could say:</p>


<pre>if ( (A=B) == 0 )...</pre>


<p>Usually, I would say, <b>don't do things like that</b>!</p>


<p>In general, the type of the expression on the right-hand side of an
assignment statement must be the same as the type of the variable on the
left-hand side. However, in some cases, the computer will automatically convert
the value computed by the expression to match the type of the variable.
Consider the list of numeric types: <span class="ptype">byte</span>, <span class="ptype">short</span>,
<span class="ptype">int</span>, <span class="ptype">long</span>, <span class="ptype">float</span>, <span class="ptype">double</span>. A value of a type
that occurs earlier in this list can be converted automatically to a value that
occurs later. For example:</p>


<pre>int A;
double X;
short B;
A = 17;
X = A;    // OK; A is converted to a double
B = A;    // illegal; no automatic conversion
          //       from int to short</pre>


<p>The idea is that conversion should only be done automatically when it can be
done without changing the semantics of the value. Any <span class="ptype">int</span> can be
converted to a <span class="ptype">double</span> with the same numeric value. However, there are
<span class="ptype">int</span> values that lie outside the legal range of <span class="ptype">short</span>s. There
is simply no way to represent the <span class="ptype">int</span> 100000 as a <span class="ptype">short</span>, for
example, since the largest value of type <span class="ptype">short</span> is 32767.</p>


<p>In some cases, you might want to force a conversion that wouldn't be done
automatically. For this, you can use what is called a <span class="newword">type cast</span>. 
A type cast is indicated by putting a type name, in
parentheses, in front of the value you want to convert. For example,</p>


<pre>int A;
short B;
A = 17;
B = (short)A;  // OK; A is explicitly type cast
               //      to a value of type short</pre>


<p>You can do type casts from any numeric type to any other numeric type.
However, you should note that you might change the numeric value of a number by
type-casting it. For example, <span class="code">(short)100000</span> is -31072. (The -31072 is
obtained by taking the 4-byte <span class="ptype">int</span> 100000 and throwing away two of
those bytes to obtain a <span class="ptype">short</span> -- you've lost the real information that
was in those two bytes.)</p>


<p>As another example of type casts, consider the problem of getting a random
integer between 1 and 6. The function <span class="code">Math.random()</span> gives a real
number between 0.0 and 0.9999..., and so <span class="code">6*Math.random()</span> is between
0.0 and 5.999.... The type-cast operator, <span class="code">(int)</span>, can be used to
convert this to an integer: <span class="code">(int)(6*Math.random())</span>. A real number is
cast to an integer by discarding the fractional part. Thus,
<span class="code">(int)(6*Math.random())</span> is one of the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. To
get a number between 1 and 6, we can add 1: "<span class="code">(int)(6*Math.random()) +
1</span>".</p>


<p>You can also type-cast between the type <span class="ptype">char</span> and the numeric types.
The numeric value of a <span class="ptype">char</span> is its Unicode code number. For example,
<span class="code">(char)97</span> is <span class="code">'a'</span>, and <span class="code">(int)'+'</span> is <span class="code">43</span>.
(However, a type conversion from <span class="ptype">char</span> to <span class="ptype">int</span> is automatic
and does not have to be indicated with an explicit type cast.)</p>


<p>Java has several variations on the assignment operator, which exist to save
typing. For example, "<span class="code">A&nbsp;+=&nbsp;B</span>" is defined to be the same as "<span class="code">A&nbsp;=&nbsp;A&nbsp;+&nbsp;B</span>". 
Every operator in Java that applies to two operands gives rise to a
similar assignment operator. For example:</p>


<pre>x -= y;     // same as:   x = x - y;
x *= y;     // same as:   x = x * y;
x /= y;     // same as:   x = x / y;
x %= y;     // same as:   x = x % y;   (for integers x and y)
q &amp;&amp;= p;    // same as:   q = q &amp;&amp; p;  (for booleans q and p)</pre>


<p>The combined assignment operator <span class="code">+=</span> even works with strings. Recall that when the <span class="code">+</span>
operator is used with a string as one of the operands, it represents
concatenation. Since <span class="code">str += x</span> is equivalent to <span class="code">str&nbsp;=&nbsp;str&nbsp;+&nbsp;x</span>,
when <span class="code">+=</span> is used with a string on the left-hand side, it appends the
value on the right-hand side onto the string. For example, if <span class="code">str</span> has
the value "tire", then the statement <span class="code">str&nbsp;+=&nbsp;'d';</span> changes the value of
<span class="code">str</span> to "tired".</p>

<a name="basics.5.7">2.5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Type Conversion of Strings</a>
</h3>
   

<p>In addition to automatic type conversions and explicit type casts, there are
some other cases where you might want to covert a value of one type into a
value of a different type.  One common example is the conversion of a <span class="classname">String</span>
value into some other type, such as converting the string <span class="code">"10"</span> into the
<span class="ptype">int</span> value 10 or the string <span class="code">"17.42e-2"</span> into
the <span class="ptype">double</span> value 0.1742.  In Java, these conversions
are handled by built-in functions.</p>
   

<p>There is a standard class named <span class="classname">Integer</span> that contains
several subroutines and variables related to the <span class="ptype">int</span> data type.  (Recall that
since <span class="ptype">int</span> is not a class, <span class="ptype">int</span> itself can't contain any subroutines or
variables.)  In particular, if <span class="code">str</span> is any expression of type <span class="classname">String</span>,
then  <span class="code">Integer.parseInt(str)</span> is a function call that attempts to convert the
value of <span class="code">str</span> into a value of type <span class="ptype">int</span>.  For example,
the value of <span class="code">Integer.parseInt("10")</span> is the <span class="ptype">int</span> value 10.
If the parameter to <span class="code">Integer.parseInt</span> does not represent a legal <span class="ptype">int</span>
value, then an error occurs.
</p>
   

<p>Similarly, the standard class named <span class="classname">Double</span> includes
a function <span class="code">Double.parseDouble</span> that tries to convert a parameter of type
<span class="classname">String</span> into a value of type <span class="ptype">double</span>.  For example,
the value of the function call <span class="code">Double.parseDouble("3.14")</span> is the
<span class="ptype">double</span> value 3.14.  (Of course, in practice, the parameter used in
<span class="code">Double.parseDouble</span> or <span class="code">Integer.parseInt</span> would be a variable
or expression rather than a constant string.)</p>


<p>Type conversion functions also exist for converting strings into enumerated
type values.  (Enumerated types, or enums, were introduced in <a href="../c2/s3.html#basics.3.3">Subection&nbsp;2.3.3</a>.)
For any enum type, a predefined function named <span class="code">valueOf</span> is automatically
defined for that type.  This is a function that takes a string as parameter and tries
to convert it to a value belonging to the enum.  The <span class="code">valueOf</span> function
is part of the enum type, so the name of the enum is part of the full name of the
function.  For example, if an enum <span class="classname">Suit</span> is defined
as</p>
   

<pre>enum Suit { SPADE, DIAMOND, CLUB, HEART }</pre>


<p>then the name of the type conversion function would be <span class="code">Suit.valueOf</span>.
The value of the function call <span class="code">Suit.valueOf("CLUB")</span> would be the
enumerated type value <span class="code">Suit.CLUB</span>.  For the conversion to succeed,
the string must exactly match the simple name of one of the enumerated type
constants (<b>without</b> the "Suit." in front).</p>

<a name="basics.5.8">2.5.8&nbsp;&nbsp;Precedence Rules</a>
</h3>


<p>If you use several operators in one expression, and if you don't use
parentheses to explicitly indicate the order of evaluation, then you have to
worry about the precedence rules that determine the order of evaluation.
(Advice: don't confuse yourself or the reader of your program; use parentheses
liberally.)</p>


<p>Here is a listing of the operators discussed in this section, listed in
order from highest precedence (evaluated first) to lowest precedence (evaluated
last):</p>


<pre>Unary operators:              ++, --, !, unary - and +, type-cast
Multiplication and division:  *,  /,  %
Addition and subtraction:     +,  -
Relational operators:         &lt;,  &gt;,  &lt;=,  &gt;=
Equality and inequality:      ==,  !=
Boolean and:                  &amp;&amp;
Boolean or:                   ||
Conditional operator:         ?:
Assignment operators:         =,  +=,  -=,  *=,  /=,  %=</pre>


<p>Operators on the same line have the same precedence. When operators of the same precedence are strung
together in the absence of parentheses, unary operators and assignment operators are evaluated right-to-left,
while the remaining operators are evaluated left-to-right. For example,
<span class="code">A*B/C</span> means <span class="code">(A*B)/C</span>, while <span class="code">A=B=C</span> means
<span class="code">A=(B=C)</span>. (Can you see how the expression <span class="code">A=B=C</span> might be
useful, given that the value of <span class="code">B=C</span> as an expression is the same as
the value that is assigned to <span class="code">B</span>?)</p>
