<h2 class="section_title">Programming Environments</h2>
<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>A</big>lthough the Java language</span> is highly
standardized, the procedures for creating, compiling, and editing Java programs
vary widely from one programming environment to another.  There are two
basic approaches: a <span class="newword">command line environment</span>,
where the user types commands and the computer responds,
and an <span class="newword">integrated development environment</span> (IDE),
where the user uses the keyboard and mouse to interact with a graphical user 
interface.  While there is just one common command line environment for Java
programming, there is a wide variety of IDEs.</p>
   

<p>I cannot give complete or definitive information on Java programming environments
in this section, but I will try to given enough information to let you compile
and run the examples from this textbook, at least in a command line environment.
There are many IDEs, and I can't cover them all here.
I will concentrate on <span class="newword">Eclipse</span>, one of the most
popular IDEs for Java programming, but some of the information that is presented
will apply to other IDEs as well.</p>


<p>One thing to keep in mind is that you do not have to pay any money
to do Java programming (aside from buying a computer, of course).  Everything
that you need can be downloaded for free on the Internet.
</p>
   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.6.1">2.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Java Development Kit</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The basic development system for Java programming is usually referred
to as the <span class="newword">JDK</span> (Java Development Kit).  It is a part of J2SE,
the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition.  This book requires J2SE version
5.0 (or higher).  Confusingly, the JDK that is part of J2SE version 5.0
is sometimes referred to as JDK&nbsp;1.5 instead of 5.0.  Note that J2SE comes in 
two versions, a Development Kit version and a Runtime version.  The
Runtime can be used to run Java programs and to view Java applets in
Web pages, but it does not allow you to compile your own Java programs.
The Development Kit includes the Runtime and adds to it the JDK which
lets you compile programs.  You need a JDK for use with this textbook.
</p>
   

<p>Java was developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc., which makes its  JDK for Windows and Linux
available for free download at its Java Web site, <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>.
If you have a Windows computer, it might have come with a Java Runtime, but
you might still need to download the JDK.  Some versions of Linux come
with the JDK either installed by default or on the installation media.
If you need to download and install the JDK, be sure to get JDK 5.0 (or higher).
As of June, 2006, the download page for JDK 5.0 can be found at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp</a>.
</p>
   

<p>Mac&nbsp;OS comes with Java.  The version included with Mac&nbsp;OS 10.4 is
1.4.2, the version previous to Java&nbsp;5.0.  However, JDK Version 5.0 is available for
Mac&nbsp;OS 10.4 on <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/java/">Apple's Web site</a>
and can also be installed through the standard Mac&nbsp;OS Software Update application.</p>
   

<p>If a JDK is installed on your computer, you can use the command line environment
to compile and run Java programs.  Some IDEs depend on the JDK, so even if you plan
to use an IDE for programming, you might still need a JDK.</p>
   

   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.6.2">2.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Command Line Environment</a>
</h3>
   

<p>Many modern computer users find the command line environment to be
pretty alien and unintuitive.  It is certainly very different from the
graphical user interfaces that most people are used to.  However, it
takes only a little practice to learn the basics of the command line
environment and to become productive using it.</p>
   

<p>To use a command line programming environment, you will have to open a window
where you can type in commands.  In Windows, you can open such a command window
by running the program named <span class="newword">cmd</span>.  One way to run
<span class="code">cmd</span> is to use the "Run Program"  feature in the Start menu,
and enter "cmd" as the name of the program.  In Mac&nbsp;OS, you want to run the
<span class="newword">Terminal</span> program, which can be be found in
the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder.  In Linux, there
are several possibilities, including <span class="newword">Konsole</span>,
<span class="newword">gterm</span>, and <span class="newword">xterm</span>.</p>
   

<p>No matter what type of computer you are using, when you open a command window,
it will display a prompt of some sort.  Type in a command at the prompt and
press return.  The computer will carry out the command, displaying any
output in the command window, and will then redisplay the prompt so that you can
type another command.   One of the central concepts in the command line
environment is the <span class="newword">current directory</span> which
contains the files to which commands that you type apply.  (The
words "directory" and "folder" mean the same thing.)   Often, the
name of the current directory is part of the command prompt.  You
can get a list of the files in the current directory by typing in the
command <span class="newword">dir</span> (on Windows) or
<span class="newword">ls</span> (on Linux and Mac&nbsp;OS).  When the window
first opens, the current directory is your <span class="newword">home directory</span>,
where all your files are stored.  You can change the current directory using
the <span class="newword">cd</span> command with the name of the
directory that you want to use.  For example, to change into your
Desktop directory, type in the command <span class="code">cd&nbsp;Desktop</span> and
press return.</p>
   

<p>You should create a directory (that is, a folder) to hold your Java work.  For example,
create a directory named <span class="code">javawork</span> in your home directory.  You can do this using
your computer's GUI; another way to do it is to open a command window and enter the command <span class="code">mkdir&nbsp;javawork</span>.
When you want to work on programming, open a command window and enter the
command <span class="code">cd&nbsp;javawork</span> to change into your work directory.
Of course, you can have more than one working directory for your Java work;
you can organize your files any way you like.</p>


<hr class="break">
   

<p>The most basic commands for using Java on the command line are
<span class="newword">javac</span> and <span class="newword">java</span>;
<span class="code">javac</span> is used to compile Java source code, and <span class="code">java</span>
is used to run Java stand-alone applications.  If
a JDK is correctly installed on your computer, it should recognize these
commands when you type them in on the command line.  Try typing the commands
<span class="code">java&nbsp;-version</span> and <span class="code">javac&nbsp;-version</span> which
should tell you which version of Java is installed.  If you get a message
such as "Command not found," then Java is not correctly installed.  If the
"java" command works, but "javac"  does not, it means that a Java Runtime
is installed rather than a Development Kit.</p>


<p>To test the <span class="code">javac</span> command, place a copy of <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span>
into your working directory.  (If you downloaded the Web site of this book,
you can find it in the directory named <span class="code">source</span>; you can use
your computer's GUI to copy-and-paste this file into your working directory.
Alternatively, you can navigate to <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> on the
book's <a href="../source/index.html">Web&nbsp;site</a> and use the 
"Save&nbsp;As" command in your Web browser to save a copy of the file into your working directory.)
Type the command:</p>
   

<pre>javac  TextIO.java</pre>
   

<p>This will compile <span class="code">TextIO.java</span> and will create a bytecode file
named <span class="code">TextIO.class</span> in the same directory.  Note that if the command
succeeds, you will not get any response from the computer; it will just redisplay
the command prompt to tell you it's ready for another command.</p>


<p>To test the <span class="code">java</span> command, copy sample program <span class="code">Interest2.java</span> from
this book's source directory into your working directory.  First, compile the program
with the command</p>
   

<pre>javac  Interest2.java</pre>
   

<p>Remember that for this to succeed, <span class="classname">TextIO</span> must already be in
the same directory.  Then you can execute the program using the command</p>
   

<pre>java  Interest2</pre>
   

<p>Be careful to use <b>just the name</b> of the program, <span class="classname">Interest2</span>,
not the name of the Java source code file or the name of the compiled class file.
When you give this command, the program will run.  You will be asked to enter some
information, and you will respond by typing your answers into the command window,
pressing return at the end of the line.  When the program ends, you will see the
command prompt, and you can enter another command.</p>


<p>You can follow the same procedure to run all of the examples in the early sections
of this book.  When you start work with applets, you will need a different command
to execute the applets.  That command will be introduced later in the book.</p>
   

<hr class="break">
   

<p>To create your own programs, you will need a <span class="newword">text editor</span>.
A text editor is a computer program that allows you to create and save documents
that contain plain text.  It is important that the documents be saved as plain text,
that is without any special encoding or formatting information.  Word processor
documents are not appropriate, unless you can get your word processor to save
as plain text.  A good text editor can make programming a lot more pleasant.
Linux comes with several text editors.  On Windows, you can use notepad in a pinch, 
but you will probably want something better.  For Mac&nbsp;OS, you might download 
the free <span class="newword">TextWrangler</span> application.  One
possibility that will work on any platform is to use <span class="newword">jedit</span>, 
a good programmer's text editor that is itself written in Java and that can be downloaded 
for free from <a href="http://www.jedit.org">www.jedit.org</a>.</p>
   

<p>To create your own programs, you should open a command line window and <span class="code">cd</span>
into the working directory where you will store your source code files.  Start up
your text editor program, such as by double-clicking its icon or selecting it from
a Start menu.  Type your code into the editor window, or open an existing source code
file that you want to modify.  Save the file.  Remember that the name of a Java
source code file must end in ".java", and the rest of the file name must match the name of the
class that is defined in the file.  Once the file is saved in your working directory,
go to the command window and use the <span class="code">javac</span> command to compile it,
as discussed above.  If there are syntax errors in the code, they will be listed
in the command window.  Each error message contains the line number in the file
where the computer found the error.  Go back to the editor and try to fix the
errors, <b>save your changes</b>, and they try the <span class="code">javac</span> command again.
(It's usually a good idea to just work on the first few errors; sometimes fixing 
those will make other errors go away.)
Remember that when the <span class="code">javac</span> command finally succeeds, you will get
no message at all.  Then you can use the <span class="code">java</span> command to run your
program, as described above.  Once you've compiled the program, you can run it as
many times as you like without recompiling it.</p>


<p>That's really all there is to it: Keep both editor and command-line window open.
Edit, save, and compile until you have eliminated all the syntax errors.  (Always
remember to save the file before compiling it -- the compiler only sees the saved
file, not the version in the editor window.)  When you run the program, you might
find that it has semantic errors that cause it to run incorrectly.  It that case,
you have to go back to the edit/save/compile loop to try to find and fix the problem.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.6.3">2.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;IDEs and Eclipse</a>
</h3>
   

<p>In an Integrated Development Environment, everything you need to create, compile, and
run programs is integrated into a single package, with a graphical user interface
that will be familiar to most computer users.  There are many different IDEs for Java program
development, ranging from fairly simple wrappers around the JDK to highly complex
applications with a multitude of features.  For a beginning programmer, there is a danger
in using an IDE, since the difficulty of learning to use the IDE, on top of the
difficulty of learning to program, can be overwhelming.  Recently, however, I
have begun using one IDE, <span class="newword">Eclipse</span>, in my introductory
programming courses.  Eclipse has a variety of features that are very useful
for a beginning programmer.  And even though it has many advanced features, its
design makes it possible to use Eclipse without understanding its full complexity.
It is likely that other modern IDEs have similar properties, but my only in-depth
experience is with Eclipse.  Eclipse is used by many professional programmers
and is probably the most commonly used Java IDE.  (In fact, Eclipse is actually
a general development platform that can be used for other purposes besides
Java development, but its most common use is Java.)
</p>
   

<p>Eclipse is itself written in Java.  It requires Java 1.4 (or higher) to run, so it works on any computer
platform that supports Java 1.4, including Linux, Windows, and recent versions of Mac&nbsp;OS. 
If you want to use Eclipse to compile and run Java&nbsp;5.0 programs,
you need Eclipse version 3.1 (or higher).  Furthermore, Eclipse requires a JDK.
You should make sure that JDK&nbsp;5.0 (or higher) is installed on your computer, as
described <a href="../c2/s6.html#basics.6.1">above</a>, <b>before</b> you install Eclipse.
Eclipse can be downloaded for free from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</a>.
</p>
   

<p>The first time you start Eclipse, you will be asked to specify a <span class="newword">workspace</span>,
which is the directory where all your work will be stored.  You can accept the default name, or
provide one of your own.  When startup is complete, the Eclipse window will be filled by a large 
"Welcome" screen that includes links to extensive documentation and tutorials.  You can close this screen, by
clicking the "X" next to the word "Welcome"; you can get back to it later by choosing "Welcome"
from the "Help" menu.</p>


<p>The Eclipse GUI consists of one large window that is divided into several sections.  Each section
contains one or more <span class="newword">views</span>.  If there are several views in one section,
there there will be tabs at the top of the section to select the view that is displayed in that
section.  Each view displays a different type of information.  The whole set of views is called
a <span class="newword">perspective</span>.  Eclipse uses different perspectives, that is different
sets of views of different types of information, for different tasks.  The only perspective
that you will need is the "Java Perspective."  Select the "Java Perspective" from the "Open
Perspective" submenu of the "Window" menu.  (You will only have to do this once, the first time
you start Eclipse.)  The Java perspective includes a large area in the center of the window
where you will create and edit your Java programs.  To the left of this is the
Package Explorer view, which will contain a list of your Java projects and source code
files.  To the right is an "Outline" view which shows an outline of the file that you
are currently editing; I don't find this very useful, and I suggest that you close the
Outline view by clicking the "X" next to the word Outline.  Several other views that will
be useful while you are compiling and running programs appear in a section of the window
below the editing area.  If you accidently close one of the important views, such as the
Package Explorer, you can get it back by selecting it form the "Show View" submenu
of the "Window" menu.</p>


<hr class="break">

      

<p>To do any work in Eclipse, you need a <span class="newword">project</span>.  To start
a Java project, go to the "New" submenu in the "File" menu, and select the "Project" command.
In the window that pops up, make sure "Java Project" is selected, and click the "Next"
button.  In the next window, it should only be necessary to fill in a "Project Name" for
the project and click the "Finish" button.  The project should appear in the
"Package Explorer" view.  Click on the small triangle next to the project name to see the
contents of the project.  At the beginning, it contains only the "JRE System Library"; this
is the collection of standard built-in classes that come with Java.</p>
   


<p>To run the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> based examples from this textbook, you must add the
source code file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> to your project.  If you have downloaded
the Web site of this book, you can find a copy of <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> in the source directory.
Alternatively, you can navigate to the file on-line and use the "Save As" command 
of your Web browser to save a copy of the file onto your computer.  The easiest way to
get <span class="classname">TextIO</span> into your project is to locate the source code file on your computer and drag the file icon
onto the project name in the Eclipse window.  If that doesn't work, you can try using
copy-and-paste:   Right-click the file icon (or control-click on Mac&nbsp;OS), select "Copy" 
from the pop-up menu, right-click the project name in the Eclipse window, and select
"Paste".  If you also have trouble with that, you can try using the "Import" command
in the "File" menu; select "File system" in the window that pops up, click "Next",
and provide the necessary information in the next window.  (Unfortunately, using
the file import window is rather complicated.  If you find that you have to use it,
you should consult the Eclipse documentation about it.)  In any case, <span class="classname">TextIO</span> should
appear in your project, inside a <span class="newword">package</span> named
"default package".  You will need to click the small triangle next to "default package"
to see the file.  Once a file is in this list, you can open it by double-clicking it;
it will appear in the editing area of the Eclipse window.</p> 


<p>To run any of the Java programs from this textbook, copy the source code file into
your Eclipse Java project.  To run the program, right-click the file name in
the Package Explorer view (or control-click in Mac&nbsp;OS).  In the menu that pops
up, go to the "Run As" submenu, and select "Java Application".  The program
will be executed.  If the program writes to standard output, the output will
appear in the "Console" view, under the editing area.  If the program uses
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> for input, you will have to type the required input into
the "Console" view -- click the "Console" view before you start typing, so that
the characters that you type will be sent to the correct part of the window.
(Note that if you don't like doing I/O in the "Console" view, you can use
an alternative version of <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/TextIO-GUI/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> that opens a separate
window for I/O.  You can find this "GUI" version of TextIO in a directory
named <span class="code">TextIO-GUI</span> inside this textbook's source directory.)
</p>
   

<p>You can have more than one program in the same Eclipse project, or you
can create additional projects to organize your work better.  Remember to
place a copy of <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> in any project that requires it.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>To create your own Java program, you must create a new Java class.
To do this, right-click the Java project name in the "Project Explorer" view.
Go to the "New" submenu of the popup menu, and select "Class".  In the
window that opens, type in the name of the class, and click the "Finish"
button.  Note that you want the name of the class, not the name of the
source code file, so don't add ".java" at the end of the name.  The class
should appear inside the "default package," and it should automatically
open in the editing area so that you can start typing in your program.
</p>
   

<p>Eclipse has several features that aid you as you type your code.
It will underline any syntax error with a jagged red line, and in some
cases will place an error marker in the left border of the edit window.
If you hover the mouse cursor over the error marker, a description of
the error will appear.  Note that you do not have to get rid of every
error immediately as you type; some errors will go away as you type
in more of the program.  If an error marker displays a small "light
bulb," Eclipse is offering to try to fix the error for you.  Click
the light bulb to get a list of possible fixes, then double click
the fix that you want to apply.  For example, if you use an undeclared
variable in your program, Eclipse will offer to declare it for you.
You can actually use this error-correcting feature to get Eclipse
to write certain types of code for you!
Unfortunately, you'll find that you won't understand a lot of the
proposed fixes until you learn more about the Java language.</p>
   

<p>Another nice Eclipse feature is <span class="newword">code assist</span>.
Code assist can be invoked by typing Control-Space.  It will offer possible
completions of whatever you are typing at the moment.  For example,
if you type part of an identifier and hit Control-Space, you will get
a list of identifiers that start with the characters that you have typed;
use the up and down arrow keys to select one of the items in the list, and
press Return or Enter.  (Or hit Escape to dismiss the list.)  If there is
only one possible completion when you hit Control-Space, it will be
inserted automatically.  By default, Code Assist will also pop up automatically,
after a short delay, when you type a period or certain other characters.
For example, if you type "<span class="code">TextIO.</span>" and pause for just a
fraction of a second, you will get a list of all the subroutines in the
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> class.  Personally, I find this auto-activation annoying.
You can disable it in the Eclipse Preferences.  (Look under Java / Editor /
Code Assist, and turn off the "Enable auto activation" option.)  You can
still call up Code Assist manually with Control-Space.</p>
   

<p>Once you have an error-free program, you can run it as described above,
by right-clicking its name in the Package Explorer and using "Run As /
Java Application".  If you find a problem when you run it, it's very
easy to go back to the editor, make changes, and run it again.  Note that
using Eclipse, there is no explicit "compile" command.  The source
code files in your project are automatically compiled, and are re-compiled
whenever you modify them.</p>
   

<p>Although I have only talked about Eclipse here, if you are using 
a different IDE, you will probably find a lot of similarities.  Most
IDEs use the concept of a "project" to which you have to add your
source code files, and most of them have menu commands for running
a program.  All of them, of course, come with built-in text editors.</p>
   



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.6.4">2.6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;The Problem of Packages</a>
</h3>
   

<p>Every class in Java is contained in something called a <span class="newword">package</span>.
Classes that are not explicitly  put into a different package are in the "default" package.
Almost all the examples in this textbook are in the default package, and I will not
even discuss packages in any depth until <a href="../c4/s5.html">Section&nbsp;4.5</a>.  However,
some IDEs might force you to pay attention to packages.</p>


<p>When you create a class in Eclipse, you might notice a message that says that
"The use of the default package is discouraged."  Although this is true, I have
chosen to use it anyway, since it seems easier for beginning programmers to
avoid the whole issue of packages, at least at first.  Some IDEs might be even
less willing to use the default package than Eclipse.  If you create
a class in a package, the source code starts with a line that specifies
which package the class is in.  For example, if the class is in a package
named <span class="code">testpkg</span>, then the first line of the source code will be
</p>


<pre>package testpkg;</pre>
   

<p>In an IDE, this will not cause any problem unless the program you are writing
depends on <span class="classname">TextIO</span>.  You will not be able to use
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> in a program unless <span class="classname">TextIO</span> is placed into
the same package as the program.  This means that you have to modify the 
source code file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> to specify the package; just add a <span class="code">package</span>
statement using the same package name as the program.  Then add the modified <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span>
to the same folder that contains the program source code.  Once you've done this,
the example should run in the same way as if it were in the default package.</p>
   

<p>By the way, if you use packages in a command-line environment, other complications
arise.  For example, if a class is in a package named <span class="code">testpkg</span>, then
the source code file must be in a subdirectory named <span class="code">testpkg</span> that
is inside your main Java working directory.  Nevertheless, when you compile or
execute the program, you should be in the main directory, not in the subdirectory.
When you compile the source code file, you have to include the name of the
directory in the command:  Use "<span class="code">javac&nbsp;testpkg/ClassName.java</span>"
on Linux or Mac&nbsp;OS, or "<span class="code">javac&nbsp;testpkg\ClassName.java</span>" on
Windows.  The command for executing the program is then
"<span class="code">java&nbsp;testpkg.ClassName</span>", with a period separating the package
name from the class name.  Since packages can contain subpackages,
it can get even worse than this!  However, you will not need to worry about
any of that when using the examples in this book.</p>
