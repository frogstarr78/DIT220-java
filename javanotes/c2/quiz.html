						Syntax it is the structure of the language. Semantics is accurately solving the problem intended by the program.<br />
						A syntax ERROR could be: <br />
						<pre>boolean booleanValue</pre>
						because the syntax of the language specifies that a semi-colin end each line that is not a statement.<br /><br />
			
						A semantic error could be:<br />
						<pre>integer halfOfSeven = 7/2;</pre>
						because this is syntactically correct, however any values evaluated with this variable would likely be wrong since <br />
						7/2 is actually 3.5.<br />

	a) increment operator. This will increment the value of a variable by one. if it is used in an assignment statement,
	it's operation depends on where it appers in relation to the variable it is operating on.

	b) boolean and operator. This will return a boolean value based on the expressions surrounding it. it will return
	true only if both expressions are true, otherwise it will yield false.

	c) relational not equal to operator. This will test that the surrounding expressions are not equal to one another.
