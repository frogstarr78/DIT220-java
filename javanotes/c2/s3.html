<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>he previous section</span> introduced the eight primitive
data types and the type <span class="classname">String</span>. There is a fundamental difference
between the primitive types and the <span class="classname">String</span> type: Values of type
<span class="classname">String</span> are objects. While we will not study objects in detail until
<a href="../c5/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>, it will be useful for you to know a
little about them and about a closely related topic: classes. This is not just
because strings are useful but because objects and classes are essential to
understanding another important programming concept, subroutines.</p>


<p>Another reason for considering classes and objects at this point is so that we can
introduce <span class="newword">enums</span>.  An enum is a data type that can be
created by a Java programmer to represent a small collection of possible
values.   Technically, an enum is a class and its possible values are objects.
Enums will be our first example of adding a new type to the Java
language.  We will look at them later in this section.

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.3.1">2.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Built-in Subroutines and Functions</a>
</h3>


<p>Recall that a subroutine is a set of program instructions that have been
chunked together and given a name. In <a href="../c4/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>,
you'll learn how to write your own subroutines, but you can get a lot done in a
program just by calling subroutines that have already been written for you. In
Java, every subroutine is contained in a class or in an object. Some classes
that are standard parts of the Java language contain predefined subroutines
that you can use. A value of type <span class="classname">String</span>, which is an object, contains
subroutines that can be used to manipulate that string.  These subroutines are
"built into" the Java language.  You can call all these
subroutines without understanding how they were written or how they work.
Indeed, that's the whole point of subroutines: A subroutine is a "black box"
which can be used without knowing what goes on inside.</p>


<p>Classes in Java have two very different functions. First of all, a class can
group together variables and subroutines that are contained in that class.
These variables and subroutines are called <span class="newword">static members</span> 
of the class. You've seen one example: In a class that defines a
program, the <span class="code">main()</span> routine is a static member of the class. The parts
of a class definition that define static members are marked with the reserved
word "<span class="code">static</span>", just like the <span class="code">main()</span> routine of a program.
However, classes have a second function. They are used to describe objects. In
this role, the class of an object specifies what subroutines and variables are
contained in that object. The class is a <b>type</b> -- in the
technical sense of a specification of a certain type of data value -- and the
object is a value of that type. For example, <span class="classname">String</span> is actually the
name of a class that is included as a standard part of the Java language. <span class="classname">String</span> is
also a type, and literal strings such as <span class="code">"Hello World"</span> represent values of
type <span class="classname">String</span>.</p>


<p>So, every subroutine is contained either in a class or in an object. Classes
<b>contain</b> subroutines called static member subroutines. Classes also
<b>describe</b> objects and the subroutines that are contained in those
objects.</p>


<p>This dual use can be confusing, and in practice most classes are designed to
perform primarily or exclusively in only one of the two possible roles. For
example, although the <span class="classname">String</span> class does contain a few rarely-used
static member subroutines, it exists mainly to specify a large number of
subroutines that are contained in objects of type <span class="classname">String</span>. Another
standard class, named <span class="classname">Math</span>, exists entirely to group together a number
of static member subroutines that compute various common mathematical
functions.</p>
   

<hr class="break">


<p>To begin to get a handle on all of this complexity, let's look at the
subroutine <span class="code">System.out.print</span> as an example. As you have seen earlier in
this chapter, this subroutine is used to display information to the user. For
example, <span class="code">System.out.print("Hello World")</span> displays the message, Hello
World.</p>


<p>
<span class="classname">System</span> is one of Java's standard classes. One of the static member
variables in this class is named <span class="code">out</span>. Since this variable is contained
in the class <span class="classname">System</span>, its full name -- which you have to use to refer
to it in your programs -- is <span class="code">System.out</span>. The variable
<span class="code">System.out</span> refers to an object, and that object in turn contains a
subroutine named <span class="code">print</span>. The compound identifier
<span class="code">System.out.print</span> refers to the subroutine <span class="code">print</span> in the object
<span class="code">out</span> in the class <span class="classname">System</span>.</p>


<p>(As an aside, I will note that the object referred to by <span class="code">System.out</span>
is an object of the class <span class="code">PrintStream</span>. <span class="code">PrintStream</span> is another
class that is a standard part of Java. <b>Any</b> object of type
<span class="code">PrintStream</span> is a destination to which information can be printed;
<b>any</b> object of type <span class="code">PrintStream</span> has a <span class="code">print</span>
subroutine that can be used to send information to that destination. The object
<span class="code">System.out</span> is just one possible destination, and
<span class="code">System.out.print</span> is the subroutine that sends information to that particular
destination. Other objects of type <span class="code">PrintStream</span> might send information
to other destinations such as files or across a network to other computers.
This is object-oriented programming: Many different things which have something
in common -- they can all be used as destinations for information -- can all be
used in the same way -- through a <span class="code">print</span> subroutine. The
<span class="code">PrintStream</span> class expresses the commonalities among all these
objects.)</p>


<p>Since class names and variable names are used in similar ways, it might be
hard to tell which is which. Remember that all the built-in, predefined names in Java follow
the rule that class names begin with an upper case letter while variable names
begin with a lower case letter. While this is not a formal syntax rule, I
recommend that you follow it in your own programming. Subroutine names should
also begin with lower case letters. There is no possibility of confusing a
variable with a subroutine, since a subroutine name in a program is always
followed by a left parenthesis.</p>
   

<p>(As one final general note, you should be aware that subroutines in Java
are often referred to as <span class="newword">methods</span>.  Generally, the
term "method" means a subroutine that is contained in a class or in an object.
Since this is true of every subroutine in Java, every subroutine in Java is
a method.  The same is not true for other programming languages.
Nevertheless, the term "method" is mostly used in the context of object-oriented
programming, and until we start doing real object-oriented programming
in <a href="../c5/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>, I will prefer to use the more general term, "subroutine.")</p>


<hr class="break">
   

<p>Classes can contain static member subroutines, as well as static member
variables. For example, the <span class="classname">System</span> class contains a subroutine named
<span class="code">exit</span>. In a program, of course, this subroutine must be referred to as
<span class="code">System.exit</span>. Calling this subroutine will terminate the program. You
could use it if you had some reason to terminate the program before the end of
the <span class="code">main</span> routine. For historical reasons, this subroutine takes an
integer as a parameter, so the subroutine call statement might look like
"<span class="code">System.exit(0);</span>" or "<span class="code">System.exit(1);</span>". (The parameter 
tells the computer why the program was terminated.  A parameter value of 0
indicates that the program ended normally. Any other value indicates that
the program was terminated because an error was detected.  But in
practice, the value of the parameter is usually ignored.)</p>


<p>Every subroutine performs some specific task. For some subroutines, that
task is to compute or retrieve some data value. Subroutines of this type are
called <span class="newword">functions</span>. We say that a function
<span class="newword">returns</span> a value. The returned value must then be
used somehow in the program.</p>


<p>You are familiar with the mathematical function that computes the square
root of a number. Java has a corresponding function called <span class="code">Math.sqrt</span>.
This function is a static member subroutine of the class named <span class="classname">Math</span>.
If <span class="code">x</span> is any numerical value, then <span class="code">Math.sqrt(x)</span> computes and
returns the square root of that value. Since <span class="code">Math.sqrt(x)</span> represents a
value, it doesn't make sense to put it on a line by itself in a subroutine call
statement such as</p>


<pre>Math.sqrt(x);   // <b>This doesn't make sense!</b>
</pre>


<p>What, after all, would the computer do with the value computed by the
function in this case? You have to tell the computer to do something with the
value. You might tell the computer to display it:</p>


<pre>System.out.print( Math.sqrt(x) );  // Display the square root of x.</pre>


<p>or you might use an assignment statement to tell the computer to store that
value in a variable:</p>


<pre>lengthOfSide = Math.sqrt(x);</pre>


<p>The function call <span class="code">Math.sqrt(x)</span> represents a value of type
<span class="ptype">double</span>, and it can be used anyplace where a numeric literal of type
double could be used.</p>


<p>The <span class="classname">Math</span> class contains many static member functions. Here is a
list of some of the more important of them:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="code">Math.abs(x)</span>, which computes the absolute value of <span class="code">x</span>.</li>


<li>The usual trigonometric functions, <span class="code">Math.sin(x)</span>,
<span class="code">Math.cos(x)</span>, and <span class="code">Math.tan(x)</span>. (For all the trigonometric
functions, angles are measured in radians, not degrees.)</li>


<li>The inverse trigonometric functions arcsin, arccos, and arctan, which are
written as: <span class="code">Math.asin(x)</span>, <span class="code">Math.acos(x)</span>, and
<span class="code">Math.atan(x)</span>.  The return value is expressed in radians, not degrees.</li>


<li>The exponential function <span class="code">Math.exp(x)</span> for computing the number e
raised to the power <span class="code">x</span>, and the natural logarithm function
<span class="code">Math.log(x)</span> for computing the logarithm of <span class="code">x</span> in the base
e.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">Math.pow(x,y)</span> for computing <span class="code">x</span> raised to the power
<span class="code">y</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">Math.floor(x)</span>, which rounds <span class="code">x</span> down to the nearest integer
value that is less than or equal to <span class="code">x</span>.   Even though the return value is
mathematically an integer, it is returned as a value of type <span class="ptype">double</span>, rather than
of type <span class="ptype">int</span> as you might expect.   For example,
<span class="code">Math.floor(3.76)</span> is 3.0.  The function <span class="code">Math.round(x)</span> returns
the integer that is closest to <span class="code">x</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">Math.random()</span>, which returns a randomly chosen <span class="ptype">double</span> in
the range <span class="code">0.0 &lt;= Math.random() &lt; 1.0</span>. (The computer actually
calculates so-called "pseudorandom" numbers, which are not truly random but are
random enough for most purposes.)</li>

</ul>


<p>For these functions, the type of the parameter -- the <span class="code">x</span> or <span class="code">y</span> inside
the parentheses -- can be any value of any numeric type. For most of the functions, the value
returned by the function is of type <span class="ptype">double</span> no matter what the type of
the parameter. However, for <span class="code">Math.abs(x)</span>, the value returned will be
the same type as <span class="code">x</span>; if <span class="code">x</span> is of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, then so is
<span class="code">Math.abs(x)</span>. So, for example, while <span class="code">Math.sqrt(9)</span> is the
<span class="ptype">double</span> value 3.0, <span class="code">Math.abs(9)</span> is the <span class="ptype">int</span> value
9.</p>


<p>Note that <span class="code">Math.random()</span> does not have any parameter. You still need
the parentheses, even though there's nothing between them. The parentheses let
the computer know that this is a subroutine rather than a variable. Another
example of a subroutine that has no parameters is the function
<span class="code">System.currentTimeMillis()</span>, from the <span class="classname">System</span> class. When this
function is executed, it retrieves the current time, expressed as the number of
milliseconds that have passed since a standardized base time (the start of the
year 1970 in Greenwich Mean Time, if you care). One millisecond is one-thousandth 
of a second. The return value of <span class="code">System.currentTimeMillis()</span> is of type
<span class="ptype">long</span>. This function can be used to measure the time that it takes the
computer to perform a task. Just record the time at which the task is begun and
the time at which it is finished and take the difference.</p>


<p>Here is a sample program that performs a few mathematical tasks and reports
the time that it takes for the program to run. On some computers, the time
reported might be zero, because it is too small to measure in milliseconds.
Even if it's not zero, you can be sure that most of the time reported by the
computer was spent doing output or working on tasks other than the program,
since the calculations performed in this program occupy only a tiny fraction of
a second of a computer's time.</p>


<pre>/**
 * This program performs some mathematical computations and displays
 * the results.  It then reports the number of seconds that the 
 * computer spent on this task.
 */

public class TimedComputation {
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
      long startTime; // Starting time of program, in milliseconds.
      long endTime;   // Time when computations are done, in milliseconds.
      double time;    // Time difference, in seconds.
      
      startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
      
      double width, height, hypotenuse;  // sides of a triangle
      width = 42.0;
      height = 17.0;
      hypotenuse = Math.sqrt( width*width + height*height );
      System.out.print("A triangle with sides 42 and 17 has hypotenuse ");
      System.out.println(hypotenuse);
      
      System.out.println("\nMathematically, sin(x)*sin(x) + "
                                       + "cos(x)*cos(x) - 1 should be 0.");
      System.out.println("Let's check this for x = 1:");
      System.out.print("      sin(1)*sin(1) + cos(1)*cos(1) - 1 is ");
      System.out.println( Math.sin(1)*Math.sin(1) 
                                        + Math.cos(1)*Math.cos(1) - 1 );
      System.out.println("(There can be round-off errors when" 
                                      + " computing with real numbers!)");
      
      System.out.print("\nHere is a random number:  ");
      System.out.println( Math.random() );
      
      endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
      time = (endTime - startTime) / 1000.0;
      
      System.out.print("\nRun time in seconds was:  ");
      System.out.println(time);
   
   } // end main()
   
} // end class TimedComputation</pre>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.3.2">2.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Operations on Strings</a>
</h3>


<p>A value of type <span class="classname">String</span> is an object. That object contains data,
namely the sequence of characters that make up the string. It also contains
subroutines. All of these subroutines are in fact functions. For example, every string object contains
a function named
<span class="code">length</span>  that computes the number of characters in that string. Suppose
that <span class="code">advice</span> is a variable that refers to a <span class="classname">String</span>. For example,
<span class="code">advice</span> might have been declared and assigned a value as follows:</p>


<pre>String advice;
advice = "Seize the day!";</pre>


<p>Then <span class="code">advice.length()</span> is a function call that returns the number of
characters in the string "Seize the day!".  In this case, the return value would be 14.
In general, for any string variable <span class="code">str</span>, the value of <span class="code">str.length()</span> is an
<span class="ptype">int</span> equal to the number of characters in the string that is the value of <span class="code">str</span>.
Note that this function has no parameter; the particular string whose length
is being computed is the value of <span class="code">str</span>.  The <span class="code">length</span> subroutine is defined by
the class <span class="classname">String</span>, and it can be used with any value of type
<span class="classname">String</span>. It can even be used with <span class="classname">String</span> literals, which are,
after all, just constant values of type <span class="classname">String</span>. For example, you could
have a program count the characters in "Hello World" for you by saying</p>


<pre>System.out.print("The number of characters in ");
System.out.println("the string \"Hello World\" is ");
System.out.println( "Hello World".length() );</pre>


<p>The <span class="classname">String</span> class defines a lot of functions. Here are some that you
might find useful. Assume that <span class="code">s1</span> and <span class="code">s2</span> refer to values of
type <span class="classname">String</span>:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="code">s1.equals(s2)</span> is a function that returns a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value.
It returns <span class="code">true</span> if <span class="code">s1</span> consists of exactly the same sequence
of characters as <span class="code">s2</span>, and returns <span class="code">false</span> otherwise.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.equalsIgnoreCase(s2)</span> is another boolean-valued function that
checks whether <span class="code">s1</span> is the same string as <span class="code">s2</span>, but this function
considers upper and lower case letters to be equivalent. Thus, if <span class="code">s1</span>
is "cat", then <span class="code">s1.equals("Cat")</span> is <span class="code">false</span>, while
s<span class="code">1.equalsIgnoreCase("Cat")</span> is <span class="code">true</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.length()</span>, as mentioned above, is an integer-valued function
that gives the number of characters in <span class="code">s1</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.charAt(N)</span>, where <span class="code">N</span> is an integer, returns a value of
type <span class="ptype">char</span>. It returns the <span class="code">N</span>-th character in the string.
Positions are numbered starting with 0, so <span class="code">s1.charAt(0)</span> is actually
the first character, <span class="code">s1.charAt(1)</span> is the second, and so on. The final
position is <span class="code">s1.length()&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span>. For example, the value of
<span class="code">"cat".charAt(1)</span> is 'a'. An error occurs if the value of the parameter
is less than zero or greater than <span class="code">s1.length()&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.substring(N,M)</span>, where <span class="code">N</span> and <span class="code">M</span> are integers,
returns a value of type <span class="classname">String</span>. The returned value consists of the
characters in <span class="code">s1</span> in positions <span class="code">N</span>, <span class="code">N+1</span>,...,
<span class="code">M-1</span>. Note that the character in position <span class="code">M</span> is not included.
The returned value is called a substring of <span class="code">s1</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.indexOf(s2)</span> returns an integer. If <span class="code">s2</span> occurs as a
substring of <span class="code">s1</span>, then the returned value is the starting position of
that substring. Otherwise, the returned value is -1. You can also use
<span class="code">s1.indexOf(ch)</span> to search for a particular character, <span class="code">ch</span>, in
<span class="code">s1</span>. To find the first occurrence of <span class="code">x</span> at or after position
<span class="code">N</span>, you can use <span class="code">s1.indexOf(x,N)</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.compareTo(s2)</span> is an integer-valued function that compares the
two strings. If the strings are equal, the value returned is zero. If
<span class="code">s1</span> is less than <span class="code">s2</span>, the value returned is a number less than
zero, and if <span class="code">s1</span> is greater than <span class="code">s2</span>, the value returned is
some number greater than zero. (If both of the strings consist entirely of
lower case letters, then "less than" and "greater than" refer to alphabetical
order. Otherwise, the ordering is more complicated.)</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.toUpperCase()</span> is a <span class="classname">String</span>-valued function that returns
a new string that is equal to <span class="code">s1</span>, except that any lower case letters
in <span class="code">s1</span> have been converted to upper case. For example,
"Cat".toUpperCase() is the string "CAT". There is also a function
<span class="code">s1.toLowerCase()</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.trim()</span> is a <span class="classname">String</span>-valued function that returns a new
string that is equal to <span class="code">s1</span> except that any non-printing characters
such as spaces and tabs have been trimmed from the beginning and from the end
of the string. Thus, if <span class="code">s1</span> has the value <span class="code">"fred&nbsp;&nbsp;"</span>, then
<span class="code">s1.trim()</span> is the string <span class="code">"fred"</span>.</li>

</ul>


<p>For the functions <span class="code">s1.toUpperCase()</span>, <span class="code">s1.toLowerCase()</span>, and
<span class="code">s1.trim()</span>, note that the value of <span class="code">s1</span> is <b>not</b> modified. Instead
a new string is created and returned as the value of the function. The returned
value could be used, for example, in an assignment statement such as "<span class="code">smallLetters =
s1.toLowerCase();</span>".  To change the value of <span class="code">s1</span>, you could
use an assignment "<span class="code">s1 = s1.toLowerCase();</span>".</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Here is another extremely useful fact about strings: You can use the plus
operator, <span class="code">+</span>, to <span class="newword">concatenate</span> two strings. The
concatenation of two strings is a new string consisting of all the characters
of the first string followed by all the characters of the second string. For
example, <span class="code">"Hello" + "World"</span> evaluates to <span class="code">"HelloWorld"</span>. (Gotta watch those
spaces, of course -- if you want a space in the concatenated string, it has to be
somewhere in the input data, as in <span class="code">"Hello&nbsp;" + "World"</span>.)</p>
   

<p>Let's suppose that <span class="code">name</span> is a variable of type
<span class="classname">String</span> and that it already refers to the name of the person using the
program. Then, the program could greet the user by executing the statement:</p>


<pre>System.out.println("Hello, "  +  name  +  ".  Pleased to meet you!");</pre>


<p>Even more surprising is that you can actually concatenate values of <b>any</b>
type onto a <span class="classname">String</span> using the <span class="code">+</span> operator. The value
is converted to a string, just as it would be if you printed it
to the standard output, and then it is concatenated onto the string. For
example, the expression <span class="code">"Number"&nbsp;+&nbsp;42</span> evaluates to the string <span class="code">"Number42"</span>. And
the statements</p>


<pre>System.out.print("After ");
System.out.print(years);
System.out.print(" years, the value is ");
System.out.print(principal);</pre>


<p>can be replaced by the single statement:</p>


<pre>System.out.print("After " + years + 
                    " years, the value is " + principal);</pre>


<p>Obviously, this is very convenient. It would have shortened some of the
examples presented earlier in this chapter.</p>

<a name="basics.3.3">2.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction to Enums</a>
</h3>
   

<p>Java comes with eight built-in primitive types and a large set of types that
are defined by classes, such as <span class="classname">String</span>.  But even
this large collection of types is not sufficient to cover all the possible situations
that a programmer might have to deal with.  So, an essential part of Java, just like
almost any other programming language, is the ability to create <b>new</b> types.  For the
most part, this is done by defining new classes; you will learn how to do that
in <a href="../c5/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.  But we will look here at one particular case:
the ability to define <span class="newword">enums</span> (short for
<span class="newword">enumerated types</span>).  Enums are a recent addition
to Java.  They were only added in Version 5.0.  Many programming languages have
something similar, and many people believe that enums should have been part
of Java from the beginning.</p>
   

<p>Technically, an enum is considered to be a special kind of class, but that 
is not important for now.  In this section, we will look at enums in a simplified
form.  In practice, most uses of enums will only need the simplified form
that is presented here.</p>
   

<p>An enum is a type that has a fixed list of possible values, which is specified
when the enum is created.  In some ways, an enum is similar to the <span class="ptype">boolean</span>
data type, which has <span class="code">true</span> and <span class="code">false</span> as its only possible
values.  However, <span class="ptype">boolean</span> is a primitive type, while an enum is not.</p>
   

<p>The definition of an enum types has the (simplified) form:</p>


<pre>enum <span class="bnf">enum-type-name</span> { <span class="bnf">list-of-enum-values</span> };</pre>


<p>This definition cannot be inside a subroutine.  You can place it <b>outside</b> the <span class="code">main()</span> routine
of the program.  The <span class="bnf">enum-type-name</span> can be any simple identifier.
This identifier becomes the name of the enum type, in the same way that "boolean" is the name of
the <span class="ptype">boolean</span> type and "String" is the name of the <span class="classname">String</span> type.
Each value in the <span class="bnf">list-of-enum-values</span> must be a simple identifier,
and the identifiers in the list are separated by commas.  For example, here is the definition
of an enum type named <span class="code">Season</span> whose values are the names of the four seasons of the year:</p>
   

<pre>enum Season { SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER };</pre>
   

<p>By convention, enum values are given names that are made up of upper case letters, but that is
a style guideline and not a syntax rule.  Enum values are not variables.  Each value is a <span class="newword">constant</span>
that always has the same value.  In fact, the possible values of an enum type are usually referred
to as <span class="newword">enum constants</span>.</p>
   

<p>Note that the enum constants of type <span class="code">Season</span> are considered to be "contained in"
<span class="code">Season</span>, which means -- following the convention that compound identifiers
are used for things that are contained in other things -- the names that you actually
use in your program to refer to them are <span class="code">Season.SPRING</span>, <span class="code">Season.SUMMER</span>, 
<span class="code">Season.FALL</span>, and <span class="code">Season.WINTER</span>.</p>
   

<p>Once an enum type has been created, it can be used to declare variables in exactly
the same ways that other types are used.  For example, you can declare a variable
named <span class="code">vacation</span> of type <span class="code">Season</span> with the statement:</p>
   

<pre>Season vacation;</pre>
   

<p>After declaring the variable, you can assign a value to it using an assignment statement.
The value on the right-hand side of the assignment can be one of the enum constants of
type <span class="code">Season</span>.  Remember to use the full name of the constant, including
"Season."!  For example:</p>
   

<pre>vacation = Season.SUMMER;</pre>
   

<p>You can print out an enum value with an output statement such as <span class="code">System.out.print(vacation)</span>.
The output value will be the name of the enum constant (without the "Season.").  In this case,
the output would be "SUMMER".</p>
   

<p>Because an enum is technically a class, the enum values are technically objects.  As objects,
they can contain subroutines.  One of the subroutines in every enum value is named <span class="code">ordinal()</span>.  When
used with an enum value, it returns the <span class="newword">ordinal number</span> of the value in the
list of values of the enum.  The ordinal number simply tells the position of the value in the list.
That is, <span class="code">Season.SPRING.ordinal()</span> is the <span class="ptype">int</span> value 0, <span class="code">Season.SUMMER.ordinal()</span> is 1,
<span class="code">Season.FALL.ordinal()</span> is 2, and <span class="code">Season.WINTER.ordinal()</span> is 3.  (You will see over
and over again that computer scientists like to start counting at zero!)  You can, of course, use
the <span class="code">ordinal()</span> method with a variable of type <span class="code">Season</span>, such 
as <span class="code">vacation.ordinal()</span> in our example.</p>
   

<p>Right now, it might not seem to you that enums are all that useful.  As you work though
the rest of the book, you should be convinced that they are.  For now, you should at least
appreciate them as the first example of an important concept: creating new types.
Here is a little example that shows enums being used in a complete program:</p>
   

<pre>public class EnumDemo {
 
       // Define two enum types -- remember that the definitions
       // go OUTSIDE The main() routine!
  
    enum Day { SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY };
      
    enum Month { JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC };
     
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       
         Day tgif;     // Declare a variable of type Day.
         Month libra;  // Declare a variable of type Month.
       
         tgif = Day.FRIDAY;    // Assign a value of type Day to tgif.
         libra = Month.OCT;    // Assign a value of type Month to libra.
           
         System.out.print("My sign is libra, since I was born in ");
         System.out.println(libra);   // Output value will be:  OCT
         System.out.print("That's the ");
         System.out.print( libra.ordinal() );
         System.out.println("-th month of the year.");
         System.out.println("   (Counting from 0, of course!)");
         
         System.out.print("Isn't it nice to get to ");
         System.out.println(tgif);   // Output value will be:  FRIDAY
          
         System.out.println( tgif + " is the " + tgif.ordinal() 
                                            + "-th day of the week.");
              // You can concatenate enum values onto Strings!
         
    }
   
}</pre>

      looks like:.</p>
