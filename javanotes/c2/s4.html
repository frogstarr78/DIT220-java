<h2 class="section_title">Text Input and Output</h2>
<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>F</big>or some unfathomable reason</span>, Java 
has never made it easy to read data typed in by the user of a program.
You've already seen that output can be displayed to the user using the
subroutine <span class="code">System.out.print</span>. This subroutine is part of a pre-defined
object called <span class="code">System.out</span>. The purpose of this object is precisely to
display output to the user.  There is a corresponding object called
<span class="code">System.in</span> that exists to read data input by the user, but it provides
only very primitive input facilities, and it requires some advanced Java
programming skills to use it effectively.</p>


<p>Java 5.0 finally makes input a little easier with a
new <span class="classname">Scanner</span> class. However, it requires some knowledge of
object-oriented programming to use this class, so it's not appropriate for use
here at the beginning of this course.  (Furthermore, in my opinion,
<span class="classname">Scanner</span> still does not get things quite right.)</p>


<p>There is some excuse for this lack of concern with input, since Java is
meant mainly to write programs for Graphical User Interfaces, and those
programs have their own style of input/output, which <b>is</b> implemented in Java.
However, basic support is needed for input/output in old-fashioned non-GUI
programs. Fortunately, it is possible to <b>extend</b> Java by
creating new classes that provide subroutines that are not available in the
standard part of the language. As soon as a new class is
available, the subroutines that it contains can be used in exactly the same way
as built-in routines.</p>


<p>Along these lines, I've written a class called <span class="classname">TextIO</span> that defines
subroutines for reading values typed by the user of a non-GUI program. The subroutines in this class
make it possible to get input from the standard input object,
<span class="code">System.in</span>, without knowing about the advanced aspects of Java that are
needed to use <span class="classname">Scanner</span>
or to use <span class="code">System.in</span> directly. <span class="classname">TextIO</span> also contains a set
of output subroutines. The output subroutines are similar to those provided in
<span class="code">System.out</span>, but they provide a few additional features.  You can use
whichever set of output subroutines you prefer, and you can even mix them in
the same program.</p>


<p>To use the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class, you must make sure that the class is
available to your program. What this means depends on the Java programming
environment that you are using.  In general, you just have to
add the source code file, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span>, to the same directory that contains
your main program.   See <a href="../c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a>
for more information about how to use <span class="classname">TextIO</span>.</p>
   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.4.1">2.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;A First Text Input Example</a>
</h3>


<p>The input routines in the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class are static member functions.
(Static member functions were introduced in the <a href="../c2/s3.html">previous section</a>.) 
Let's suppose that you want your program to read an integer typed
in by the user. The <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class contains a static member function
named <span class="code">getlnInt</span> that you can use for this purpose. Since this function is
contained in the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class, you have to refer to it in your program
as <span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt</span>. The function has no parameters, so a complete call to the
function takes the form "<span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt()</span>". This function call
represents the <span class="ptype">int</span> value typed by the user, and you have to do
something with the returned value, such as assign it to a variable. For
example, if <span class="code">userInput</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span> (created with
a declaration statement "<span class="code">int userInput;</span>"), then you could use the
assignment statement</p>


<pre>userInput = TextIO.getlnInt();</pre>


<p>When the computer executes this statement, it will wait for the user to type
in an integer value. The value typed will be returned by the function, and it
will be stored in the variable, <span class="code">userInput</span>. Here is a complete program
that uses <span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt</span> to read a number typed by the user and then
prints out the square of the number that the user types:</p>


<pre>/**
 * A program that reads an integer that is typed in by the
 * user and computes and prints the square of that integer.
 */
 
public class PrintSquare {
    
     public static void main(String[] args) {
 
        int userInput;  // The number input by the user.
        int square;     // The userInput, multiplied by itself.
        
        System.out.print("Please type a number: ");
        userInput = TextIO.getlnInt();
        square = userInput * userInput;
        System.out.print("The square of that number is ");
        System.out.println(square);
        
     } // end of main()
  
} //end of class PrintSquare</pre>


<p>When you run this program, it
will display the message "Please type a number:" and will pause until you type
a response, including a carriage return after the number.
 Here is an applet that simulates the program.
(<b>Note:</b>  If the applet does not respond to your typing, you might have to
click on it to activate it.  In some browsers, you might also need to leave the
mouse cursor inside the applet for it to recognize your typing.)</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.4.2">2.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Text Output</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class contains static member subroutines
<span class="code">TextIO.put</span> and <span class="code">TextIO.putln</span> that can be used in the same way
as <span class="code">System.out.print</span> and <span class="code">System.out.println</span>. For example,
although there is no particular advantage in doing so in this case, you could
replace the two lines</p>


<pre>
<b>System.out.print</b>("The square of that number is ");
<b>System.out.println</b>(square);</pre>


<p>with</p>


<pre>
<b>TextIO.put</b>("The square of that number is ");
<b>TextIO.putln</b>(square);</pre>


<p>For the next few chapters, I will use <span class="classname">TextIO</span> for input in all my
examples, and I will often use it for output. Keep in mind that <span class="classname">TextIO</span>
can only be used in a program if it is available to that
program. It is not built into Java in the way that the <span class="classname">System</span> class is.</p>



<p>Let's look a little more closely at the built-in output subroutines
<span class="code">System.out.print</span> and <span class="code">System.out.println</span>.  Each of these
subroutines can be used with one parameter, where the parameter can be a
value of any of the primitive types <span class="ptype">byte</span>, <span class="ptype">short</span>, <span class="ptype">int</span>, <span class="ptype">long</span>,
<span class="ptype">float</span>, <span class="ptype">double</span>, <span class="ptype">char</span>, or <span class="ptype">boolean</span>.
The parameter can also be a <span class="classname">String</span>, a value belonging to an enum type,
or indeed any object.  That is, you can say "<span class="code">System.out.print(x);</span>" or
"<span class="code">System.out.println(x)</span>;", where <span class="code">x</span> is any expression
whose value is of any type whatsoever.  The expression can be a constant, a variable,
or even something more complicated such as <span class="code">2*distance*time</span>.  Now, in fact,
the <span class="classname">System</span> class actually includes several different subroutines to handle different
parameter types. There is one <span class="code">System.out.print</span> for printing values of
type <span class="ptype">double</span>, one for values of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, another for values
that are objects, and so on. These subroutines can have the same name
since the computer can tell which one you mean in a given subroutine call
statement, depending on the type of parameter that you supply. Having several
subroutines of the same name that differ in the types of their parameters is
called <span class="newword">overloading</span>. Many programming languages do
not permit overloading, but it is common in Java programs.</p>


<p>The difference between <span class="code">System.out.print</span> and
<span class="code">System.out.println</span> is that the <span class="code">println</span> version outputs a
carriage return after it outputs the specified parameter value. There is a
version of <span class="code">System.out.println</span> that has no parameters. This version
simply outputs a carriage return, and nothing else.  A subroutine
call statement for this version of the program looks like
"<span class="code">System.out.println();</span>", with empty parentheses. Note that
"<span class="code">System.out.println(x)</span>;" is exactly equivalent to
"<span class="code">System.out.print(x); System.out.println();</span>"; the carriage
return comes <b>after</b> the value of <span class="code">x</span>.  (There is no version of
<span class="code">System.out.print</span> without parameters. Do you see why?)</p>


<p>As mentioned above, the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> subroutines <span class="code">TextIO.put</span> and
<span class="code">TextIO.putln</span> can be used as replacements for <span class="code">System.out.print</span>
and <span class="code">System.out.println</span>.  The <span class="classname">TextIO</span> functions work in
exactly the same way as the <span class="classname">System</span> functions, except that, as we will
see below, <span class="classname">TextIO</span> can also be used to write to other destinations.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.4.3">2.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;TextIO Input Functions</a>
</h3>


<p>The <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class is a little more versatile at doing output than is
<span class="code">System.out</span>. However, it's input for which we really need it.</p>


<p>With <span class="classname">TextIO</span>, input is done using functions. For example,
<span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt()</span>, which was discussed above, makes the user type in a
value of type <span class="ptype">int</span> and returns that input value so that you can use it
in your program. <span class="classname">TextIO</span> includes several functions for reading
different types of input values.  Here are examples of the ones that you are
most likely to use:</p>


<pre>j = TextIO.getlnInt();     // Reads a value of type int.
y = TextIO.getlnDouble();  // Reads a value of type double.
a = TextIO.getlnBoolean(); // Reads a value of type boolean.
c = TextIO.getlnChar();    // Reads a value of type char.
w = TextIO.getlnWord();    // Reads one "word" as a value of type String.
s = TextIO.getln();        // Reads an entire input line as a String.</pre>


<p>For these statements to be legal, the variables on the left side of each
assignment statement must already be declared and must be of the same type as 
that returned by the function on the right side.  Note carefully that
these functions do not have parameters.  The values that they return come
from outside the program, typed in by the user as the program is running.
To "capture" that data so that you can use it in your program, you have
to assign the return value of the function to a variable.  You will then
be able to refer to the user's input value by using the name of the variable.</p>


<p>When you call one of these functions, you are guaranteed that it will return
a legal value of the correct type. If the user types in an illegal value as
input -- for example, if you ask for an <span class="ptype">int</span> and the user types in a
non-numeric character or a
number that is outside the legal range of values that can be stored in
in a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span> -- then the computer will
ask the user to re-enter the value, and your program never sees the first,
illegal value that the user entered.  For <span class="code">TextIO.getlnBoolean()</span>,
the user is allowed to type in any of the following: true, false, t, f, yes, no, y,
n, 1, or 0.  Furthermore, they can use either upper or lower case letters.
In any case, the user's input is interpreted as a true/false value.  It's
convenient to use <span class="code">TextIO.getlnBoolean()</span> to read the user's
response to a Yes/No question.</p>


<p>You'll notice that there are two input functions that return Strings. The
first, <span class="code">getWord()</span>, returns a string consisting of non-blank characters
only. When it is called, it skips over any spaces and carriage returns typed in
by the user. Then it reads non-blank characters until it gets to the next space
or carriage return. It returns a <span class="classname">String</span> consisting of all the
non-blank characters that it has read. The second input function,
<span class="code">getln()</span>, simply returns a string consisting of all the characters
typed in by the user, including spaces, up to the next carriage return. It gets
an entire line of input text. The carriage return itself is not returned as
part of the input string, but it is read and discarded by the computer. Note
that the String returned by this function might be the <span class="newword">empty string</span>, 
<span class="code">""</span>, which contains no characters at
all.  You will get this return value if the user simply presses return, without
typing anything else first.</p>


<p>All the other input functions listed -- <span class="code">getlnInt()</span>, 
<span class="code">getlnDouble()</span>, <span class="code">getlnBoolean()</span>, and
<span class="code">getlnChar()</span> -- behave like <span class="code">getWord()</span> in that they will skip
past any blanks and carriage returns in the input before reading a value.</p>


<p>Furthermore, if the user types extra characters on the line after the
input value, <b>all the extra characters will be discarded, along with
the carriage return at the end of the line</b>.  If the
program executes another input function, the user will have to type in
another line of input.  It might not sound like a good idea to discard any
of the user's input, but it turns out to be the safest thing to do in most
programs.  Sometimes, however, you do want to read more than one value
from the same line of input.  <span class="classname">TextIO</span> provides the following
alternative input functions to allow you to do this:</p>


<pre>j = TextIO.getInt();     // Reads a value of type int.
y = TextIO.getDouble();  // Reads a value of type double.
a = TextIO.getBoolean(); // Reads a value of type boolean.
c = TextIO.getChar();    // Reads a value of type char.
w = TextIO.getWord();    // Reads one "word" as a value of type String.</pre>
   

<p>The names of these functions start with "get" instead of "getln".
"Getln" is short for "get line" and should remind you that the functions
whose names begin with "getln" will get an entire line of data.  A function
without the "ln" will read an input value in the same way, but will then
save the rest of the input line in a  chunk of internal memory
called the  <span class="newword">input buffer</span>.
The next time the computer wants to read an input value, it will look
in the input buffer before prompting the user for input.  This allows the
computer to read several values from one line of the user's input.
Strictly speaking, the computer actually reads <b>only</b> from the input buffer.
The first time the program tries to read input from the user, the
computer will wait while the user types in an entire line of
input. <span class="classname">TextIO</span> stores that line in the input buffer until
the data on the line has been read or discarded (by one of the "getln"
functions).  The user only gets to
type when the buffer is empty.</p>
   

<p>Clearly, the semantics of input is much more complicated than the semantics of output!
Fortunately, for the majority of applications, it's pretty straightforward in practice.
You only need to follow the details if you want to do something fancy.  In particular,
I <b>strongly</b> advise you to use the "getln" versions of
the input routines, rather than the "get" versions, unless you really want to
read several items from the same line of input, precisely because the semantics
of the "getln" versions is much simpler.
</p>
   

<p>Note, by the way, that although the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> input functions will
skip past blank spaces and carriage returns while looking for input, they will 
<b>not</b> skip past other characters.  For example, if you try
to read two <span class="ptype">int</span>s and the user types "2,3", the computer will read the
first number correctly, but when it tries to read the second number, it will
see the comma. It will regard this as an error and will force the user to
retype the number. If you want to input several numbers from one line, you
should make sure that the user knows to separate them with spaces, not commas.
Alternatively, if you want to require a comma between the numbers, use
<span class="code">getChar()</span> to read the comma before reading the second number.</p>


<p>There is another character input function, <span class="code">TextIO.getAnyChar()</span>,
which does not skip past blanks or carriage returns. It simply reads and
returns the next character typed by the user, even if it's a blank or 
carriage return. If the user typed a carriage return,
then the <span class="ptype">char</span> returned by <span class="code">getAnyChar()</span> is the special linefeed
character '\n'. There is also a function, <span class="code">TextIO.peek()</span>, that lets
you look ahead at the next character in the input without actually reading it.
After you "peek" at the next character, it will still be there when you read
the next item from input. This allows you to look ahead and see what's coming
up in the input, so that you can take different actions depending on what's
there.</p>


<p>The <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class provides a number of other functions.  To
learn more about them, you can look at the comments in the source code file
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/TextIO.java">source code</a></span>.</p>


<p>(You might be wondering why there are only two output routines, <span class="code">put</span>
and <span class="code">putln</span>, which can output data values of any type, while there is a
separate input routine for each data type. As noted above, in reality there are
many <span class="code">put</span> and <span class="code">putln</span> routines, one for each data type. The computer can tell them apart
based on the type of the parameter that you provide. However, the input
routines don't have parameters, so the different input routines can only be
distinguished by having different names.)</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Using <span class="classname">TextIO</span> for input and output, we can now improve the program
from <a href="../c2/s2.html">Section&nbsp;2.2</a> for computing the value of an investment.
We can have the user type in the initial value of the investment and the
interest rate. The result is a much more useful program -- for one thing, it
makes sense to run more than once!</p>

public class Interest2 {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
       double principal;  // The value of the investment.
       double rate;       // The annual interest rate.
       double interest;   // The interest earned during the year.
       
       TextIO.put("Enter the initial investment: ");
       principal = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       
       TextIO.put("Enter the annual interest rate (decimal, not percentage!): ");
       rate = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       
       interest = principal * rate;       // Compute this year's interest.
       principal = principal + interest;  // Add it to principal.
       
       TextIO.put("The value of the investment after one year is $");
       TextIO.putln(principal);
       
   } // end of main()
      
} // end of class Interest2</pre>

<p>By the way, the applets on this page don't actually use <span class="classname">TextIO</span> itself. The
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> class is only for use in programs, not applets. For applets, I
have written a separate class that provides similar input/output capabilities
in a Graphical User Interface program.  Remember that the applets are only
<i>simulations</i> of the programs.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.4.4">2.4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Formatted Output</a>
</h3>


<p>If you ran the preceding <span class="code">Interest2</span> example, you might have noticed that
the answer is not always written in the format that is usually used for dollar amounts.
In general, dollar amounts are written with two digits after the decimal point.
But the program's output can be a number like 1050.0 or 43.575.  It would be better
if these numbers were printed as 1050.00 and 43.58.</p>
   

<p>Java 5.0 introduced a formatted output capability that makes it much easier than
it used to be to control the format of output numbers.  A lot of formatting options
are available.  I will cover just a few of the simplest and most commonly used
possibilities here.</p>
   

<p>You can use the function <span class="code">System.out.printf</span> to produce formatted
output.  (The name "printf," which stand for "print formatted," is copied from
the C and C++ programming languages, which have always have a similar formatting
capability).  <span class="code">System.out.printf</span> takes two or more parameters.
The first parameter is a <span class="classname">String</span> that specifies the format of the
output.  This parameter is called the <span class="newword">format string</span>.
The remaining parameters specify the values that are to be output.  Here is
a statement that will print a number in the proper format for a dollar amount,
where <span class="code">amount</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">double</span>:
</p>
   

<pre>System.out.printf( "%1.2f", amount );</pre>
   

<p>
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> can also do formatted output. The function <span class="code">TextIO.putf</span>
has the same functionality as <span class="code">System.out.printf</span>.  Using <span class="classname">TextIO</span>,
the above example would be: <span class="code">TextIO.printf(&nbsp;"%1.2",&nbsp;amount&nbsp;);</span>
and you could say <span class="code">TextIO.putln("%1.2f",principal);</span> instead of 
<span class="code">TextIO.putln(principal);</span> in the <span class="code">Interest2</span> program to get
the output in the right format.
</p>
   

<p>The output format of a value is specified by a <span class="newword">format specifier</span>.
The format string (in the simple cases that I cover here) contains one format specifier for
each of the values that is to be output.  Some typical format specifiers are 
<span class="code">%d</span>, <span class="code">%12d</span>, <span class="code">%10s</span>, <span class="code">%1.2f</span>, <span class="code">%15.8e</span> and <span class="code">%1.8g</span>.
Every format specifier begins with a percent sign (<span class="code">%</span>) and ends with a letter, possibly with
some extra formatting information in between.  The letter specifies the type of output
that is to be produced.  For example, in <span class="code">%d</span> and <span class="code">%12d</span>,
the "d" specifies that an integer is to be written.  The "12" in <span class="code">%12d</span>
specifies the minimum number of spaces that should be used for the output.  If the
integer that is being output takes up fewer than 12 spaces, extra blank spaces
are added in front of the integer to bring the total up to 12.  We say that the
output is "right-justified in a field of length 12."  The value is not forced into
12 spaces; if the value has more than 12 digits, all the digits will be printed, with
no extra spaces.  The specifier <span class="code">%d</span> means the same as <span class="code">%1d</span>;
that is an integer will be printed using just as many spaces as necessary.
(The "d," by the way, stands for "decimal" (base-10) numbers.  You can use an "x" to
output an integer value in hexadecimal form.)
</p>
   

<p>The letter "s" at the end of a format specifier can be used with any type of value.
It means that the value should be output in its default format, just as it would be
in unformatted output.  A number, such as the "10" in <span class="code">%10s</span> can
be added to specify the (minimum) number of characters.  The "s" stands for "string,"
meaning that the value is converted into a <span class="classname">String</span> value in the usual way.</p>
   

<p>The format specifiers for values of type <span class="ptype">double</span> are even more complicated.
An "f", as in <span class="code">%1.2f</span>, is used to output a number in "floating-point" form,
that is with digits after the decimal point.  In <span class="code">%1.2f</span>, the "2" specifies
the number of digits to use after the decimal point.  The "1" specifies the (minimum)
number of characters to output, which effectively means that just as many characters
as are necessary should be used.  Similarly, <span class="code">%12.3f</span> would specify a
floating-point format with 3 digits after the decimal point, right-justified in a
field of length 12.</p>
   

<p>Very large and very small numbers should be written in exponential format, such
as 6.00221415e23, representing "6.00221415 times 10 raised to the power 23."
A format specifier such as <span class="code">%15.8e</span> specifies an output in exponential
form, with the "8" telling how many digits to use after the decimal point.
If you use "g" instead of "e", the output will be in floating-point form for
small values and in exponential form for large values.  In <span class="code">%1.8g</span>,
the 8 gives the total number of digits in the answer, including both the
digits before the decimal point and the digits after the decimal point.</p>
   

<p>In addition to format specifiers, the format string in a <span class="code">printf</span> statement
can include other characters.  These extra characters are just copied to the
output.  This can be a convenient way to insert values into the middle of an
output string.  For example, if <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are variables
of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, you could say</p>
   

<pre>System.out.printf("The product of %d and %d is %d", x, y, x*y);</pre>
   

<p>When this statement is executed, the value of <span class="code">x</span> is substituted for the
first <span class="code">%d</span> in the string, the value of <span class="code">y</span> for the second
<span class="code">%d</span>, and the value of the expression <span class="code">x*y</span> for the third,
so the output would be something like "The product of 17 and 42 is 714" (quotation
marks not included in output!).

<a name="basics.4.5">2.4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction to File I/O</a>
</h3>
   

<p>
<span class="code">System.out</span> sends its output to the output destination known as
"standard output."  But standard output is just one possible output destination.
For example, data can be written to a <span class="newword">file</span> that
is stored on the user's hard drive.  The advantage to this, of course, is that
the data is saved in the file even after the program ends, and the user can
print the file, email it to someone else, edit it with another program, and so
on.</p>
   

<p>
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> has the ability to write data to files and to read data
from files.  When you write output using the <span class="code">put</span>, <span class="code">putln</span>,
or <span class="code">putf</span> method in <span class="classname">TextIO</span>, the output is sent to
the <span class="newword">current output destination.</span>  By default,
the current output destination is standard output.  However, <span class="classname">TextIO</span>
has some subroutines that can be used to change the current output destination.
To write to a file named "result.txt", for example, you would use the
statement:</p>
 

<pre>TextIO.writeFile("result.txt");</pre>
   

<p>After this statement is executed, any output from <span class="classname">TextIO</span> output
statements will be sent to the file named "result.txt" instead of to standard
output.  The file should be created in the same directory that contains 
the program.  Note that if a file with the same name already exists, its previous
contents will be erased!   In many cases, you want to let the user select
the file that will be used for output.  The statement</p>
   

<pre>TextIO.writeUserSelectedFile();</pre>
   

<p>will open a typical graphical-user-interface file selection dialog where
the user can specify the output file.  If you want to go back to sending output
to standard output, you can say</p>
   

<pre>TextIO.writeStandardOutput();</pre>


<p>You can also specify the input source for <span class="code">TextIO's</span> various
"get" functions.  The default input source is standard input.  You can use
the statement <span class="code">TextIO.readFile("data.txt")</span> to read from
a file named "data.txt" instead, or you can let the user select the
input file by saying <span class="code">TextIO.readUserSelectedFile()</span>,
and you can go back to reading from standard input with
<span class="code">TextIO.readStandardInput()</span>.</p>
   

<p>When your program is reading from standard input, the user gets
a chance to correct any errors in the input.  This is not possible
when the program is reading from a file.  If illegal data is found
when a program tries to read from a file, an error occurs that
will crash the program. (Later, we will see that is is possible
to "catch" such errors and recover from them.)  Errors can also
occur, though more rarely, when writing to files.</p>
   

<p>A complete understanding of file input/output in Java requires
a knowledge of object oriented programming.  We will return to
the topic later, in <a href="futurelink">Chapter 11</a>.
The file I/O capabilities in <span class="classname">TextIO</span> are rather
primitive by comparison.  Nevertheless, they are sufficient 
for many applications, and they will allow you to get some
experience with files sooner rather than later.
</p>
   

<p>As a simple example, here is a program that asks the user some
questions and outputs the user's responses to a file named
"profile.txt":</p>
   

<pre>public class CreateProfile {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        String name;     // The user's name.
        String email;    // The user's email address.
        double salary;   // the user's yearly salary.
        String favColor; // The user's favorite color.
  
        TextIO.putln("Good Afternoon!  This program will create");
        TextIO.putln("your profile file, if you will just answer");
        TextIO.putln("a few simple questions.");
        TextIO.putln();
  
        /* Gather responses from the user. */
      
        TextIO.put("What is your name?           ");
        name = TextIO.getln();
        TextIO.put("What is your email address?  ");
        email = TextIO.getln();
        TextIO.put("What is your yearly income?  ");
        salary = TextIO.getlnDouble();
        TextIO.put("What is your favorite color? ");
        favColor = TextIO.getln();
    
        /* Write the user's information to the file named profile.txt. */
      
        TextIO.writeFile("profile.txt");  // subsequent output goes to the file
        TextIO.putln("Name:            " + name); 
        TextIO.putln("Email:           " + email);
        TextIO.putln("Favorite Color:  " + favColor);
        TextIO.putf( "Yearly Income:   %1.2f\n", salary);
                   // The "/n" in the previous line is a carriage return.
       
        /* Print a final message to standard output. */
          
        TextIO.writeStandardOutput();
        TextIO.putln("Thank you.  Your profile has been written to profile.txt.");
        
    }
    
}</pre>
