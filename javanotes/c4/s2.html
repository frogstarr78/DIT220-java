<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>E</big>very subroutine in Java</span> must be defined inside
some class. This makes Java rather unusual among programming languages, since
most languages allow free-floating, independent subroutines. One purpose of a
class is to group together related subroutines and variables. Perhaps the
designers of Java felt that everything must be related to something. As a less
philosophical motivation, Java's designers wanted to place firm controls on the
ways things are named, since a Java program potentially has access to a huge
number of subroutines created by many different programmers. The fact that those
subroutines are grouped into named classes (and classes are grouped into named
"packages") helps control the confusion that might result from so many
different names.</p>


<p>A subroutine that is a member of a class is often called a <span class="newword">method</span>, 
and "method" is the term that most people prefer for
subroutines in Java. I will start using the term "method" occasionally;
however, I will continue to prefer the more general term "subroutine" for static
subroutines. I will use the term "method" most often to refer to non-static
subroutines, which belong to objects rather than to classes. This chapter will
deal with static subroutines almost exclusively. We'll turn to non-static
methods and object-oriented programming in the <a href="../c5/index.html">next
chapter</a>.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="subroutines.2.1">4.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Subroutine Definitions</a>
</h3>


<p>A subroutine definition in Java takes the form:</p>


<pre>
<span class="bnf">modifier</span>  <span class="bnf">return-type</span>  <span class="bnf">subroutine-name</span>  ( <span class="bnf">parameter-list</span> ) {
    <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}</pre>


<p>It will take us a while -- most of the chapter -- to get through what all
this means in detail. Of course, you've already seen examples of subroutines in
previous chapters, such as the <span class="code">main()</span> routine of a program and the
<span class="code">paint()</span> routine of an applet. So you are familiar with the general
format.</p>


<p>The <span class="bnf">statements</span> between the braces, { and }, in a subroutine definition
make up the <span class="newword">body</span> of the subroutine. These
statements are the inside, or implementation part, of the "black box", as
discussed in the <a href="../c4/s1.html">previous section</a>. They are the
instructions that the computer executes when the method is called. Subroutines
can contain any of the statements discussed in <a href="../c2/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> and
<a href="../c3/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>.</p>


<p>The <span class="bnf">modifiers</span> that can occur at the
beginning of a subroutine definition are words that set certain characteristics
of the subroutine, such as whether it is static or not. The modifiers that you've
seen so far are "<span class="code">static</span>" and "<span class="code">public</span>". There are only about a
half-dozen possible modifiers altogether.</p>


<p>If the subroutine is a function, whose job is to compute some value, then
the <span class="bnf">return-type</span> is used to specify the type of
value that is returned by the function. We'll be looking at functions and
return types in some detail in <a href="../c4/s4.html">Section&nbsp;4.4</a>. If the
subroutine is not a function, then the <span class="bnf">return-type</span> is replaced 
by the special value <span class="code">void</span>,
which indicates that no value is returned. The term "void" is meant to indicate
that the return value is empty or non-existent.</p>


<p>Finally, we come to the <span class="bnf">parameter-list</span> of
the method. Parameters are part of the interface of a subroutine. They
represent information that is passed into the subroutine from outside, to be
used by the subroutine's internal computations. For a concrete example, imagine
a class named <span class="classname">Television</span> that includes a method named
<span class="code">changeChannel()</span>. The immediate question is: What channel should it
change to? A parameter can be used to answer this question. Since the channel
number is an integer, the type of the parameter would be <span class="ptype">int</span>, and the
declaration of the <span class="code">changeChannel()</span> method might look like</p>


<pre>public void changeChannel(int channelNum) { ... }</pre>


<p>This declaration specifies that <span class="code">changeChannel()</span> has a parameter
named <span class="code">channelNum</span> of type <span class="ptype">int</span>. However, <span class="code">channelNum</span>
does not yet have any particular value. A value for <span class="code">channelNum</span> is
provided when the subroutine is called; for example:
<span class="code">changeChannel(17);</span>
</p>


<p>The parameter list in a subroutine can be empty, or it can consist of one or
more parameter declarations of the form <span class="bnf">type</span>&nbsp;<span class="bnf">parameter-name</span>. If there are several
declarations, they are separated by commas. Note that each declaration can name
only one parameter. For example, if you want two parameters of type
<span class="ptype">double</span>, you have to say "<span class="code">double&nbsp;x,&nbsp;double&nbsp;y</span>", rather than
"<span class="code">double x, y</span>".</p>


<p>Parameters are covered in more detail in the <a href="../c4/s3.html">next
section</a>.</p>


<p>Here are a few examples of subroutine definitions, leaving out the
statements that define what the subroutines do:</p>


<pre>public static void playGame() {
    // "public" and "static" are modifiers; "void" is the 
    // return-type; "playGame" is the subroutine-name; 
    // the parameter-list is empty.
    . . .  // Statements that define what playGame does go here.
}

int getNextN(int N) {
    // There are no modifiers; "int" in the return-type
    // "getNextN" is the subroutine-name; the parameter-list 
    // includes one parameter whose name is "N" and whose 
    // type is "int".
    . . .  // Statements that define what playGame does go here.
}

static boolean lessThan(double x, double y) {
    // "static" is a modifier; "boolean" is the
    // return-type; "lessThan" is the subroutine-name; the 
    // parameter-list includes two parameters whose names are 
    // "x" and "y", and the type of each of these parameters 
    // is "double".
    . . .  // Statements that define what playGame does go here.
}</pre>


<p>In the second example given here, <span class="code">getNextN</span> is a non-static method,
since its definition does not include the modifier "<span class="code">static</span>" -- and so
it's not an example that we should be looking at in this chapter! The other
modifier shown in the examples is "<span class="code">public</span>". This modifier indicates
that the method can be called from anywhere in a program, even from outside the
class where the method is defined. There is another modifier,
"<span class="code">private</span>", which indicates that the method can be called
<b>only</b> from inside the same class. The modifiers <span class="code">public</span>
and <span class="code">private</span> are called <span class="newword">access specifiers</span>.
If no access specifier is given for a method, then by default, that method can
be called from anywhere in the "package" that contains the class, but not from
outside that package. (Packages were introduced in <a href="../c2/s6.html#basics.6.4">Subection&nbsp;2.6.4</a>,
and you'll learn more about them later in this
chapter, in <a href="../c4/s5.html">Section&nbsp;4.5</a>.)  There is one other access
modifier, <span class="code">protected</span>, which will only become relevant when we turn to
object-oriented programming in <a href="../c5/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.</p>


<p>Note, by the way, that the <span class="code">main()</span> routine of a program follows the
usual syntax rules for a subroutine. In</p>


<pre>public static void main(String[] args) { ... }</pre>


<p>the modifiers are <span class="code">public</span> and <span class="code">static</span>, the return type is
<span class="code">void</span>, the subroutine name is <span class="code">main</span>, and the parameter list is
"<span class="code">String[]&nbsp;args</span>". The only question might be about "<span class="code">String[]</span>",
which has to be a type if it is to match the syntax of a parameter list. In
fact, <span class="code">String[]</span> represents a so-called "array type", so the syntax is
valid. We will cover arrays in <a href="../c7/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;7</a>. (The
parameter, <span class="code">args</span>, represents information provided to the program when
the <span class="code">main()</span> routine is called by the system. In case you know the term,
the information consists of any "command-line arguments" specified in the
command that the user typed to run the program.)</p>


<p>You've already had some experience with filling in the implementation of a
subroutine. In this chapter, you'll learn all about writing your own complete
subroutine definitions, including the interface part.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="subroutines.2.2">4.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling Subroutines</a>
</h3>


<p>When you define a subroutine, all you are doing is telling the computer that
the subroutine exists and what it does. The subroutine doesn't actually get
executed until it is called. (This is true even for the <span class="code">main()</span> routine
in a class -- even though <b>you</b> don't call it, it is called by
the system when the system runs your program.) For example, the
<span class="code">playGame()</span> method given as an example above could be called using the following
subroutine call statement:</p>


<pre>playGame();</pre>


<p>This statement could occur anywhere in the same class that includes the
definition of <span class="code">playGame()</span>, whether in a <span class="code">main()</span> method or in
some other subroutine. Since <span class="code">playGame()</span> is a <span class="code">public</span> method,
it can also be called from other classes, but in that case, you have to tell
the computer which class it comes from.  Since <span class="code">playGame()</span> is a <span class="code">static</span> method,
its full name includes the name of the class in which it is defined.  Let's say, for example, that
<span class="code">playGame()</span> is defined in a class named <span class="code">Poker</span>. Then to call
<span class="code">playGame()</span> from <b>outside</b> the <span class="code">Poker</span> class, you would
have to say</p>


<pre>Poker.playGame();</pre>


<p>The use of the class name here tells the computer which class to look in to
find the method.  It also lets you distinguish between <span class="code">Poker.playGame()</span>
and other potential <span class="code">playGame()</span> methods defined in other classes, such
as <span class="code">Roulette.playGame()</span> or <span class="code">Blackjack.playGame()</span>.</p>


<p>More generally, a <span class="newword">subroutine call statement</span> for a <span class="code">static</span>
subroutine takes the form</p>


<pre>
<span class="bnf">subroutine-name</span>(<span class="bnf">parameters</span>);</pre>


<p>if the subroutine that is being called is in the same class, or</p>


<pre>
<span class="bnf">class-name</span>.<span class="bnf">subroutine-name</span>(<span class="bnf">parameters</span>);</pre>


<p>if the subroutine is defined elsewhere, in a different
class. (Non-static methods belong to objects rather than classes, and they are
called using object names instead of class names. More on that later.) Note
that the parameter list can be empty, as in the <span class="code">playGame()</span> example,
but the parentheses must be there even if there is nothing between them.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="subroutines.2.3">4.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Subroutines in Programs</a>
</h3>


<p>It's time to give an example of what a complete program looks like, when it
includes other subroutines in addition to the <span class="code">main()</span> routine. Let's
write a program that plays a guessing game with the user. The computer will
choose a random number between 1 and 100, and the user will try to guess it.
The computer tells the user whether the guess is high or low or correct. If the
user gets the number after six guesses or fewer, the user wins the game. After
each game, the user has the option of continuing with another game.</p>


<p>Since playing one game can be thought of as a single, coherent task, it
makes sense to write a subroutine that will play one guessing game with the
user. The <span class="code">main()</span> routine will use a loop to call the
<span class="code">playGame()</span> subroutine over and over, as many times as the user wants
to play. We approach the problem of designing the <span class="code">playGame()</span>
subroutine the same way we write a <span class="code">main()</span> routine: Start with an
outline of the algorithm and apply stepwise refinement. Here is a short
pseudocode algorithm for a guessing game program:</p>


<pre>Pick a random number
while the game is not over:
    Get the user's guess
    Tell the user whether the guess is high, low, or correct.</pre>


<p>The test for whether the game is over is complicated, since the game ends if
either the user makes a correct guess or the number of guesses is six. As in
many cases, the easiest thing to do is to use a "<span class="code">while (true)</span>" loop
and use <span class="code">break</span> to end the loop whenever we find a reason to do so.
Also, if we are going to end the game after six guesses, we'll have to keep
track of the number of guesses that the user has made. Filling out the
algorithm gives:</p>


<pre>Let computersNumber be a random number between 1 and 100
Let guessCount = 0
while (true):
    Get the user's guess
    Count the guess by adding 1 to guess count
    if the user's guess equals computersNumber:
        Tell the user he won
        break out of the loop
    if the number of guesses is 6:
        Tell the user he lost
        break out of the loop
    if the user's guess is less than computersNumber:
        Tell the user the guess was low
    else if the user's guess is higher than computersNumber:
        Tell the user the guess was high</pre>


<p>With variable declarations added and translated into Java, this becomes the
definition of the <span class="code">playGame()</span> routine. A random integer between 1 and
100 can be computed as <span class="code">(int)(100&nbsp;* Math.random())&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</span>. I've cleaned up
the interaction with the user to make it flow better.</p>


<pre>static void playGame() {
    int computersNumber; // A random number picked by the computer.
    int usersGuess;      // A number entered by user as a guess.
    int guessCount;      // Number of guesses the user has made.
    computersNumber = (int)(100 * Math.random()) + 1;
             // The value assigned to computersNumber is a randomly
             //    chosen integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
    guessCount = 0;
    TextIO.putln();
    TextIO.put("What is your first guess? ");
    while (true) {
       usersGuess = TextIO.getInt();  // Get the user's guess.
       guessCount++;
       if (usersGuess == computersNumber) {
          TextIO.putln("You got it in " + guessCount
                  + " guesses!  My number was " + computersNumber);
          break;  // The game is over; the user has won.
       }
       if (guessCount == 6) {
          TextIO.putln("You didn't get the number in 6 guesses.");
          TextIO.putln("You lose.  My number was " + computersNumber);
          break;  // The game is over; the user has lost.
       }
       // If we get to this point, the game continues.
       // Tell the user if the guess was too high or too low.
       if (usersGuess &lt; computersNumber)
          TextIO.put("That's too low.  Try again: ");
       else if (usersGuess &gt; computersNumber)
          TextIO.put("That's too high.  Try again: ");
    }
    TextIO.putln();
} // end of playGame()</pre>


<p>Now, where exactly should you put this? It should be part of the same class
as the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, but <b>not</b> inside the main routine. It is not
legal to have one subroutine physically nested inside another. The
<span class="code">main()</span> routine will <b>call</b> <span class="code">playGame()</span>, but not contain
it physically. You can put the definition of <span class="code">playGame()</span> either before
or after the <span class="code">main()</span> routine. Java is not very picky about having the
members of a class in any particular order.</p>


<p>It's pretty easy to write the main routine. You've done things like this
before. Here's what the complete program looks like (except that a serious
program needs more comments than I've included here).</p>


<pre>public class GuessingGame {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      TextIO.putln("Let's play a game.  I'll pick a number between");
      TextIO.putln("1 and 100, and you try to guess it.");
      boolean playAgain;
      do {
         playGame();  // call subroutine to play one game
         TextIO.put("Would you like to play again? ");
         playAgain = TextIO.getlnBoolean();
      } while (playAgain);
      TextIO.putln("Thanks for playing.  Goodbye.");
   } // end of main()            
   
   static void playGame() {
       int computersNumber; // A random number picked by the computer.
       int usersGuess;      // A number entered by user as a guess.
       int guessCount;      // Number of guesses the user has made.
       computersNumber = (int)(100 * Math.random()) + 1;
                // The value assigned to computersNumber is a randomly
                //    chosen integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
       guessCount = 0;
       TextIO.putln();
       TextIO.put("What is your first guess? ");
       while (true) {
          usersGuess = TextIO.getInt();  // Get the user's guess.
          guessCount++;
          if (usersGuess == computersNumber) {
             TextIO.putln("You got it in " + guessCount
                     + " guesses!  My number was " + computersNumber);
             break;  // The game is over; the user has won.
          }
          if (guessCount == 6) {
             TextIO.putln("You didn't get the number in 6 guesses.");
             TextIO.putln("You lose.  My number was " + computersNumber);
             break;  // The game is over; the user has lost.
          }
          // If we get to this point, the game continues.
          // Tell the user if the guess was too high or too low.
          if (usersGuess &lt; computersNumber)
             TextIO.put("That's too low.  Try again: ");
          else if (usersGuess &gt; computersNumber)
             TextIO.put("That's too high.  Try again: ");
       }
       TextIO.putln();
   } // end of playGame()
               
} // end of class GuessingGame</pre>


<p>Take some time to read the program carefully and figure out how it works.
And try to convince yourself that even in this relatively simple case, breaking
up the program into two methods makes the program easier to understand and
probably made it easier to write each piece.</p>

   

<p>You can try out a simulation of this program here:</p>

<a name="subroutines.2.4">4.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Member Variables</a>
</h3>


<p>A class can include other things besides subroutines. In particular, it can
also include variable declarations. Of course, you can declare variables
<b>inside</b> subroutines.  Those are called <span class="newword">local variables.</span> 
However, you can also have variables that are
not part of any subroutine. To distinguish such variables from local variables,
we call them <span class="newword">member variables</span>, since they are
members of a class.</p>


<p>Just as with subroutines, member variables can be either static or
non-static. In this chapter, we'll stick to static variables. A static member
variable belongs to the class itself, and it exists as long as the class
exists. Memory is allocated for the variable when the class is first loaded by
the Java interpreter. Any assignment statement that assigns a value to the
variable changes the content of that memory, no matter where that assignment
statement is located in the program. Any time the variable is used in an
expression, the value is fetched from that same memory, no matter where the
expression is located in the program. This means that the value of a static
member variable can be set in one subroutine and used in another subroutine.
Static member variables are "shared" by all the static subroutines in the
class. A local variable in a subroutine, on the other hand, exists only while
that subroutine is being executed, and is completely inaccessible from outside
that one subroutine.</p>


<p>The declaration of a member variable looks just like the declaration of a
local variable except for two things: The member variable is declared outside
any subroutine (although it still has to be inside a class), and the
declaration can be marked with modifiers such as <span class="code">static</span>,
<span class="code">public</span>, and <span class="code">private</span>. Since we are only working with static
member variables for now, every declaration of a member variable in this
chapter will include the modifier <span class="code">static</span>.  They might also
be marked as <span class="code">public</span> or <span class="code">private</span>.  For example:</p>


<pre>static String usersName;
public static int numberOfPlayers;
private static double velocity, time;</pre>


<p>A static member variable that is not declared to be <span class="code">private</span> can be
accessed from outside the class where it is defined, as well as inside. When it
is used in some other class, it must be referred to with a compound identifier
of the form <span class="bnf">class-name</span>.<span class="bnf">variable-name</span>. For example, the <span class="classname">System</span> class
contains the public static member variable named <span class="code">out</span>, and you use this
variable in your own classes by referring to <span class="code">System.out</span>. If
<span class="code">numberOfPlayers</span> is a public static member variable in a class named
<span class="code">Poker</span>, then subroutines in the <span class="code">Poker</span> class would refer to it
simply as <span class="code">numberOfPlayers</span>, while subroutines in another class would refer to
it as <span class="code">Poker.numberOfPlayers</span>.</p>


<p>As an example, let's add a static member variable to the
<span class="code">GuessingGame</span> class that we wrote earlier in this section. This
variable will be used to keep track of how many games the user wins. We'll call
the variable <span class="code">gamesWon</span> and declare it with the statement 
"<span class="code">static&nbsp;int&nbsp;gamesWon;</span>" In the <span class="code">playGame()</span> routine, we add 1 to
<span class="code">gamesWon</span> if the user wins the game. At the end of the <span class="code">main()</span>
routine, we print out the value of <span class="code">gamesWon</span>. It would be impossible to
do the same thing with a local variable, since we need access to the same
variable from both subroutines.</p>


<p>When you declare a local variable in a subroutine, you have to assign a
value to that variable before you can do anything with it. Member variables, on
the other hand are automatically initialized with a default value. For numeric
variables, the default value is zero. For <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variables, the
default is <span class="code">false</span>. And for <span class="ptype">char</span> variables, it's the
unprintable character that has Unicode code number zero. (For objects, such as
<span class="code">Strings</span>, the default initial value is a special value called
<span class="code">null</span>, which we won't encounter officially until later.)</p>


<p>Since it is of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, the static member variable
<span class="code">gamesWon</span> automatically gets assigned an initial value of zero. This
happens to be the correct initial value for a variable that is being used as a
counter. You can, of course, assign a different value to the variable at the
beginning of the <span class="code">main()</span> routine if you are not satisfied with the
default initial value.</p>


<p>Here's a revised version of <span class="code">GuessingGame.java</span> that includes the
<span class="code">gamesWon</span> variable. The changes from the above version are shown in
red:</p>
