				</span> questions on Chapter 4 of <a href="../index.html"><i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i></a>.  You should be able to answer these questions about studying that chapter.  Sample answers to these questions can be found <a href="quiz_answers.html">here</a>.

						<p>A "black box" has an interface and an implementation. Explain what is meant by the terms <i>interface</i> and <i>implementation</i>.</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2" class="answers">
						An interface is the way in which processes exterior to the black box interact with it. It also encompases what the capable 
						uses of the black box.
						The implementation is the black box's internal processes and method in which it solves the problem(s) it's intended to.

				<tr class="question">
					<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;2:</span></td>
					<td>
						<p>A subroutine is said to have a <i>contract</i>. What is meant by the contract of a subroutine? 
						When you want to use a subroutine, why is it important to understand its contract? 
						The contract has both "syntactic" and "semantic" aspects. What is the syntactic aspect? What is the semantic aspect?</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2" class="answers">
						The subroutines "contract" is the strict method in which you have to use the subroutine and the expected behavior gained by using the subroutine.	
						It's important to understand this because you don't want to call it incorrectly, you'll likely get a syntax error. Likewise you wouldn't want to
						call it in the wrong circumstance because the behavior that you expect will likely not be the result that occurs.
						The syntatic aspect is the literal specification of is needed to type in order to correctly use the subroutine.
						The semantic aspect is the intended consequence of using the subroutine.

				<tr class="question">
					<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;3:</span></td>
					<td>
						<p>Briefly explain how subroutines can be a useful tool in the top-down design of programs.</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2" class="answers">
						As different tasks are specified toward the resolution of a problem, subroutines can be utilized to encapsulate different and more specific
						details. By having a shared library or API of standard subroutines available for use, these levels of detail are more managable as
						different layers rely on the pre-defined, already resolved details, of less important details relative to the current task resolution.

				<tr class="question">
					<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;4:</span></td>

						<p>Discuss the concept of <i>parameters.</i> What are parameters for? 
						What is the difference between <i>formal parameters</i> and <i>actual parameters</i>?</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2" class="answers">
						Parameters are the literal arguments used to define the interface to a subroutine. Specified arguments of the subroutine's interface.
						Formal parameters are the parameters that are declared in the subroutine's definition. They are also the internal variables that 
						are used to refer to the eventual, actual parameters, when it is called.
						The actual parameters are the parameters that are passed to the subroutine when it called.

					<p>What is an API? Give an example.</p>
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td colspan="2" class="answers">
						Application Programming Interface. This is the suite of Subroutines, Classes and Packages that provide a programmic interface 
						necessary to solving a computational problem. Someone writting a computer game would use an API to control the environment that
						makes up the game. They would/could use subroutines that defined different aspects of character movement, different parameters
						of the games graphical environment, game winning conditions, difficulty levels, etc.
